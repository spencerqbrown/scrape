CH H,5.0,"After multiple visits to this Anthony's Cranston location, I had to post a good review to the Above Average warm service that I am always greeted by every time I visit! We mainly get ""take-out"" and have dined in a few other times on the outside patio or high tops and our food has always been perfect! Specifically ""take-out"" when the order is complete and not like other restaurants always seem to have some sauce, side item or such missing once you get home that makes ya nuts. We happen to love their margarita pizza, pot of meatballs, the smooth tasty sauce and Family sized salad- dressing is so simple and salad always fresh and crisp--Delicious!
But what really adds to me feeling great every time we leave is the warmth and upbeat service received, from the the time we enter, to just passing by the friendly bartender, then reaching the take-out stand in the rear, we normally have been acknowledged by 2-3 employees, that have just said a simple ""hello with a smile"" or offered assistance (even while their busy passing by) and the staff seem to really enjoy working together and working off of each other for help and I think it really comes down from the manager, Trisha H. She really sets a tone with a positive dining environment and is so pleasant, every and all interactions or assistance she provides us or when she assists a server taking our order. Trisha even helped when something wrong on our ""rewards account"" that another Anthony's location in Mass, had messed up repeatedly and seemed unable to correct, yet Trisha saw the issue in the system and fixed it w/out issue with a smile!
Kudos for the great customer service and exemplifying real hospitality service from one of your frequent visitors when over in Cranston! Thank you to your Team & keep up the good work! - Colleen",a month ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 220 Hillside Rd CRANSTON RI 2920 (401) 943-1601

Jack Mefford,1.0,"Rhode Island pizza at Manhattan prices. I'm far from cheap but I almost fell out of my chair when the bill came. 2 medium sized meatball appetizer at $8, but even more egregious was the $18 for a small 12' cheese pizza for my son and a $24 for a small 12' 2 topping (meatball and ricotta). Each of the 6 slices was smaller than my 11 year old son's hand, which at $4 per slice seems insane. Decent enough pie, but come on, there's over a dozen places nearby where I can get a small pie for under $10. Hardly worth the money.",11 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 220 Hillside Rd CRANSTON RI 2920 (401) 943-1601

Gabriel Gambino,5.0,"Great food, friendly staff, overall a great casual pizza parlor / restaurant.

The 3 Cheese Pizza is excellent.

The Italian Tuna Sandwich is amazing!

They have a nice little bar if you feel like hanging out at night.

Great selection of beer.

Prices are reasonable and the quality of food & drinks are outstanding.

Caitlynn was our waitress, she was attentive, pleasant and professional. Great waitress!

Tracy is an amazing girl. We were so happy upper management moved her into a new management position.

Girls like Tracy make places like Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza an outstanding place to visit. She is full of life, full of happiness, extremely professional and without a doubt cares about the customer.

Her amazing attitude is unparalleled!

Overall, Anthony's is a great place to visit for a night out.

Mary Fernandez,2.0,"First time trying this place..  they took about 10 min to come get our drinks order and the restaurant was pretty much empty.. then we place our order for food and drinks  (just water)  the appetizer was out in about 5 mins, I have never seen food come out that fast!? But that’s ok, then our waitress proceeded to give us the utensils, I couldn’t believe my eyes.. the knife was so dirty!! Wish I could upload the picture.. I proceeded to give the knife to the waitress.. (she didn’t even bother saying sorry) just took it and brought me another one.. the pizza came a little after that but by that point I was so turn off by the fork being dirty that I didn’t really care about the food..  it makes me sad to see that more and more restaurants don’t care about their cleanliness or about the little details.. I had been thinking about trying this place out for a while .. I am not sure if would go back but besides the utensils being dirty I would say pizza was good..",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 220 Hillside Rd CRANSTON RI 2920 (401) 943-1601

My visit tonight was the worst yet. My wings were tasty but a little tough. i asked that I get my wings first then the two meatball dish. it all came out at the same time so by the time i git to the meatballs they were cold. Maybe it was because of the place was so empty but when cold the meatballs were tastless andd the bread hard.

Not only was it expensive, but the pizza wasn’t even that good. The cauliflower pizza was so salty, I had to take the entire top off. It didn’t really have dimensions to it’s flavor, besides the salt. It was also really greasy. When I folded the pizza, grease was dripping off of it. Truly a waste of $22. Not worth it at all. I’ve had better pizza at Dominos and other local pizzerias for a cheaper price.

J. Romeo Aldana,1.0,"I have eaten at a handful of other coal fired pizza restaurants in New York, Connecticut, And Providence. Unfortunately I have to say Anthony's doesn't even come close.

When I walked in I instantly could tell this was a chain restaurant. The decor is tacky and cookie cutter.

I ordered the wings which are topped with cooked Onions ( I mean alot of Onions). You end up eating onion flavored chicken wings and because there is so much onions on top the wings get soggy very quick. Also the wings were not really that hot almost as if they were Partially cooked and re heated in the coal oven.

I ordered a small Pauly's pizza. Again the pizza was not very hot. All of the coal oven pizzas I've ever had are light and crisp with good char flavor from oven, and always very hot. This pizza was on the thicker side and soggy. The taste was bland, and It had way too many toppings on it. Yes pizzas can have too many toppings.

Anyway service was fine no complaints on the staff at all.

Ananya Gupta,2.0,I am not sure what the crazies with this pizza however I found it to be lacking in both taste and texture. The crust and this pizza is too thick and bready while the sauce and cheese on the top are not enough in proportion to provide depth in flavor. In fact unlike a good pizza this one tastes chewy and terrible if it is allowed to sit out cold. This pizza tastes heavily industrialized.

Excellent service with very friendly staff.
Prices are decent.
Had Philly cheesesteak pizza which was really delicious, the main issues with meat pizzas is meat fatty taste and stick that comes with it. But not this one, I beleive they used good quality leab meat, with good spices.
We also had egg plant one, was not happy as it only had tiny amount of cheese on top, and when we told the server he got us a new one with extra cheese that was really tasty.
As for the crust, it was great, crispy, thin and had the perfect amount of black charred edges.
