Walked over to pickup after confirming they were the ones one block from the Sheraton with them during the order. Got there and they said there was no order for me.  I asked if the number I dialed, showing her my phone, if it was this store. She said no. Went to redial the number to have them deliver to my hotel thinking I must have called the wrong place. Had to listen to the phone commercials and finally they answered. They said there was no order for me. Hung up and compared the phone log to the Google address and phone number which matched the 6th Street store I was standing at. They are morons, stay away from this store

Scott Carter,2.0,"Good prices, all things considering, and a different offering than other pizza delivery companies. Didn't taste half bad either. However, that's where the nice part ends.

Pizza tracker ticked on and on, order wasn't processed for a long time. Took almost an hour and half to get two pizzas less than two miles away. Driver took a very sketchy imprint of my card because it was apparently ""policy"" despite me still signing the receipt showing I had already paid. Imprints should have died out years ago for this industry, but not here.

Days later, that same card hit a $600 fraudulent charge from a random store in Iceland and I had to cancel it. No proof it was this Pizza Hut but extremely coincidental.

Dave Dave,2.0,"(Translated by Google) Fast delivery therefore also 2 instead of 1 star. The pizza itself is unfortunately not really enjoyable, especially if you bring a courier who smokes in the car and the ashtray in the car is completely overcrowded. I smoke myself but in connection with food deliveries this is a no go. The pizza was not satisfactory even if it is very cheap. Maybe I also got the wrong day for it.

We placed are order and then sat down and waited for our food.

Mary Morris,3.0,"Pizza Hut has declined a great deal. It used to be our favorite pizza, but now I will never order from there again!

To begin with, the order taker was not very good.  In the past, they would recognize my phone number and call me by name.  All in a cheerful, upbeat tone of voice.  Tonight, the order taker was somewhat ""mechanical"" and acted like I had never ordered before.

We ordered a large Meat Lovers pizza.  Nothing else.  Our bill was $27 and change.  When the pizza arrived, I was shocked to see that there was barely any meat on our pizza!  We paid nearly $30 for about $5 worth of meat!

Never, ever again will we order anything from Pizza Hut!  They have hit rock bottom!",a month ago,Open,1000804832

Sarah,1.0,"We ordered online and picked it up. We got there a few minutes after our order was to be ready, we parked and clicked ""I'm here"" from the website. We waited over 15 minutes outside before I made several phone call attempts which were unanswered. Finally, Kyle came outside, saw us and said ""oh!"" before he did a 180 and went back inside to get our food. I brought up the wait and he told me they were understaffed... ""crazy busy"" and ""answering phones"". I told him that wasn't necessarily true because when I called no one answered. His response was to then turn around and walk away. I asked him for his name before he got back into the building and told him to have a good night. Funny enough, the sentiment wasn't reciprocated.  As we drove by he front, I saw no customers inside to corroborate his claims as to why it took over 15 minutes to bring our food out. When we got home, the breadsticks were soggy, the stuffed crust was hard and the pizzas were just overall chewy. We were all so excited but we're left so underwhelmed and disappointed.",a month ago,Open,1000804832

The waitress came to take our order, it took quite a long time for an order of Chicken wings and a personal pan pizza . Now mind you a cheese pizza, and an order of boneless wings takes aprox. 7 minutes to cook, other than the lady with the screaming animals, we were the only ones in there other than some friends of the staff, who got plenty of attention. We needed a refill on drinks, but no one was around, so my  husband got up to go get it himself, no one even noticed this. once the food was delivered, the chicken wings came out before my pizza so he was served his meal while I sat there . His wings didn't even come with carrots or celery, ok,, I guess, but we were not even offered any kind of sauce such as Blu cheese or ranch NOTHING just chicken nuggets with some hot sauce on a plate .I picked up the salt shaker it was crud crusted with gunk on the top even.. ok, I got up to grab one on the next table,, same thing, after three separate attempts with salt shakers from three different tables, I gave up,, all of them were filthy. The cheese and pepper flake shakers were no better. I worked in the food and beverage industry for 30 years. I understand that sometimes something may be over looked from time to time, BUT in this place EVERYTHING was over looked, from cleanliness,of the establishment right down to personal hygiene. The silverware was even dirty, I could not even ask for replacements because there was no one there,,, until it was time to pay,, they showed up for that tip though, Get it together, you are a corporate chain,,, wow , I wonder if headquarters ever shows up? When I go into an establishment and the salt and pepper shakers are unfilled and dirty, I usually just leave because this means that they are not doing their jobs if they can not be bothered to do even the simplest of tasks, I don't want to eat there.If they can't be bothered to wipe down a salt shaker, what does the kitchen look like????

We order the family order: came with pepperoni pizza, cheese pizza, bread sticks, pepperoni rolls with a side of chicken wings. The pizza was 'cold', the pizza rolls were under cooked. We were not given any dipping sauces for the bread sticks or wings.
I am very displeased. Pizza Hut has always been my favorite. The family likes Domino's. We will be going back to Domino's.

The store is only 7 mins from our home if there is traffic. The driver did not come to our side door as instructed. However, he was very pleasant!

So very sorry Pizza Hut, gonna miss you.

We ordered a pizza, bread sticks and iced tea. We wanted cheese sauce for the bread sticks and was told that they don't have it and our only choice was marinara sauce. Our iced tea was old and almost soured.
When we left the salad bar was still filled and i don't understand what we couldn't have had 1 bowl of salad from it.

Now with that being said I was told 25 minutes my delivery would arrive..... One hour and 20 minutes later the guy has pulled up to the address sitting in car on the phone while our crushed order continues to grow cold. Lots of sauces ordered and almost all the sauces were crushed in boxes. 
Requested parmesan and crushed red pepper never got it. THEN 2 minutes after I hand the young driver the money he comes back and tells me i need to pay for the order i never gave him the money while others witnessed me hand him 46 dollars. 
He leaves and 20 minutes later comes back with cheese and crushed red pepper after we are done eating...... I will say I dont want a refund or any compensation . I will not do business with this pizza hut ever!!!!! There is no excuse for this type of service.",9 months ago,Open,1000804899
