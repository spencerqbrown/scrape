Liz,1.0,The reason the im giving one start is because I placed an order online to be picked up at 5:50 but when I arrive the food was not ready and I had to wait 25 minutes more of pick up time.

jararaca 1984,5.0,"I've been here many times, but I will say, the new additions to the menu were needed and are delicious. I rarely like spaghetti and meatballs from anywhere other than my own kitchen. Everywhere you go the sauce is poured over the wet noodles and is disgusting. Not Anthony's! Anthony's does spaghetti and meatballs the right way. Not only are the meatballs delicious,  but they cook the pasta and sauce together in a pan so the sauce isn't flooding the plate and coats the noodles. The pasta was drained properly and just done right. The sauce is delicious and has a hint of heat.  Delicious!

Michael Boyer,5.0,"Update: took a friend and his wife there for his birthday and Kiki, Imame and Kirsten really made dinner special.  They had this special pizza made with his age made out of sausage.  it was really funny and everyone came out singing.  I can't say enough about the staff as they make you feel like family.   I am going to have to give Anthony's a bit of a black eye as I find your bar prices way to high for this area.  I'm used to seeing those prices when I'm in the big cities like NY or DC but not Wyomissing, PA.  Everytime I go in the bar is very sparse because you can go down the street and have a cocktail for much less.  I think you need to look at your prices.  There is no way a double Jameson and coke should be $13.50.  This won't stop me from coming in and enjoying good food but the cocktails will have to not happen.  Again Kiki has always made us feel so very welcome.  You have a good employee with her.

I go to Anthonys when I'm in the mood for a pizza like no other around.  the use fresh ingredients and have unique blends.  Their pizza is cooked in coal fired ovens which cooks the pizza in just minutes.  The chicken wings are tops as they are dry cooked in the coal ovens with onions.  They are so so good.  The meatballs are top as well.  Cold craft beer, good spirits and exceptionally friendly staff.  The manager always comes around and checks to make sure that everything is to my liking.  Parking can be a bit challenging during busy times but if you are in the area stop and grab a pie, beer or sandwich, you won't be sorry",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2733 Papermill Rd WYOMISSING PA 19610-3339 (610) 816-5722

Rosa Henne,2.0,"As a Assistant Manger in another Restaurant I would like to say the structure of taking control seems not clear. let me explain...
I came in on a Sunday for lunch12pm with a few of my colleagues, HAD A GREAT PIZZA LUNCH, we like to look around to observe what transpire in a dinning setting. We first look over at the cook area- and saw a mid teen handling the ovens- doing an extremely well job ( thought to my self- I would like him to work for me) while scanning thru the room, notice the person who is on the floor (male & female) does not interact with the customer(s) although they had no problem pointing finger and giving out orders to other employee about their job. It was distasteful, we were looking around to acknowledge the supervisor/manager, but could not tell. At, end of our lunch we figured out who is in charged, realized that their is no structure or control. I held back - all i know if it was me- the ones causing issues AND not keeping them self busy would not last long.

Bryan Hayward,4.0,"The food is not your typical sports bar/pizza place. The atmosphere is misleading.   You think you're going into (yet another)  ""pizza place"" that is really a sports bar.   However,  the food is *amazing*.  The ingredients are top notch.   The wings are actually flavorful,  not just drowned in dressing or hot sauce (in fact, they aren't normally served with any coating).  They come skillfully marinated,  naked, and grilled with onions.   The pizza ingredients are fresh and though the crust is crunchy,  the ingredients still taste like their fresh counterparts without being overcooked.   The sandwiches are delightfully green (including arugula and basil) and yet satisfying for carnivores.  The cannolis are tasty all the way through,  from the handmade filling to the crunchy and flaky  shell.  The service was outstanding.

Eric Rothenberger,5.0,"There's something about the taste of stuff cooked over coals that just appeals to me on some primal, industrial level.

I highly recommend the wings. The caramelized onions that accompany the wings are good enough to eat on their own. The char on them is just perfect.

Pizza is another staple here. I have tried 4 or 5 different kinds and haven't been disappointed. The crispness of the crust from the coal stove is what makes it for me.

Fairly good drink selection and prompt service as well. Reasonably priced. Can't recommend this place enough.",3 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2733 Papermill Rd WYOMISSING PA 19610-3339 (610) 816-5722

Elvin Berndt,1.0,"I have eaten at several of Anthony's locations and always had great service and great food.  This location was by far the worst dinning experiences I have ever had.  Our family went there while visiting our daughter at college and wanted to have dinner before driving back.

We ordered a salad, 4 meatballs, a pizza and a chicken sandwich.  The salad came out no problem.  After about 25 minutes later I asked a waiter if he could check on our food.  After about 10 minutes our original waiter returned and said our pizza would be out shortly because they ran out of meatballs for the pizza?  They said meatballs where their signature dish and that is what they were known for....

We finally got our pizza about 50 minutes after ordering with our daughters chicken sandwich being served 5 minutes later.  The waiter again apologized and said the manager would be be over to talk to us.  I said I would prefer to not speak with manager and that we just wanted to eat our pizza and get on our way.  As we began to eat, a young man who identified himself as the manager came over and said "" so what's up"" I told him I would prefer to not speak with him and that we just wanted to eat our meal.  He continued to stand next to me and ask why.  I again turned and said you know what the issue is and we would just prefer to be left alone so we could eat.  He continued to probe and I finally said that the problem was the service and I would prefer not to discuss it.  We continued our meal and women named Vanessa (who also identified herself as the manager) came to the table and asked if she could assist.  I told her I just wanted my bill.  Her and the staff stood across the room, and based on the fact they all kept looking at us I can only assume we were the topic of their discussion.  When she returned, she asked one of my guest if there was a problem.  My guest said no, why do you ask.  She said I saw you staring at me so I thought you had a problem.

Bottom line, this location has poor leadership which resulted in a terrible customer experience, mediocore food and has lost Anthony's a customer for life.

PS... After ackowledging their service issues, neither manager offered any kind of courtesy discount to try and appease our group.  No problem... You have seen the last of our money.",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2733 Papermill Rd WYOMISSING PA 19610-3339 (610) 816-5722

David Burkhart,5.0,"We really enjoyed our first experience with this restaurant.  The staff was very friendly, and the food was excellent!  We had the cheesesteak pizza, and when we placed our order we were informed that their cheesesteak pizza was served without sauce.  We were given the option to have sauce added or on the side.  We requested sauce on the side but ended up eating almost all of it without.  The crust was crispy (as advertised) and the meat and cheese were both very good.

Ashton Weinberger,1.0,"My boyfriend and I were looking forward to the opening of this new location near us, but ended up having a very unimpressive and unsatisfying experience.

The website advertises that Anthony's has local craft beers on draft. WRONG! We sat at the bar, and read the draft list written on the chalkboard on the wall, and let me tell you something, Red Hook and Angry Orchard ARE NOT LOCAL CRAFT BEERS! There were about 3 beers listed that were local, but what do you know? THEY WERE COMPLETELY OUT OF ALL OF THEM. Hey I got an idea guys, instead of trying to be cute and trendy by writing your draft list on a chalkboard, take it to the next step AND ERASE THE BEER THAT YOU RUN OUT OF! This will save a lot of time for everyone, and won't get anyone's hopes up.

We ended up ordering Peronis (NOT LOCAL CRAFT BEER) and a pizza. Unfortunately, the pizza took 40 minutes to come out, and half of it was burned to a crisp and inedible. Maybe this explains the ""Pizza Well Done"" disclaimers printed all over the walls?

The pizza we ordered was the Paul & Young Ron with the choice of hot or sweet peppers. We chose the hot pepper option, and the pizza was topped with WHOLE green chilies that had not been sliced, and the seeds and pith (squishy insides) had not been removed. This is an absolutely unacceptable way to serve green chilies and the concept is neither ""unique"" nor appetizing. Biting into the peppers fills your mouth with seeds and pepper guts that you immediately want to spit out.

Additionally, green chili peppers ARE NOT HOT PEPPERS! We asked the bartender/server what the sweet pepper option was, and she replied that it was red bell peppers. We then asked her if the red bell peppers were served WHOLE on the pizza, but that was over her head.

On top of it all, the speakers BLAST a terrible music selection across every genre, creating the vibe of a washed up karaoke bar lacking any ambiance whatsoever.

We were very disappointed by this restaurant, and would not recommend it.",6 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2733 Papermill Rd WYOMISSING PA 19610-3339 (610) 816-5722
