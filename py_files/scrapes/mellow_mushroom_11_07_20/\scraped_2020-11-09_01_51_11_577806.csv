Justin Hinton,3.0,This is a uniquely styled pizza joint. The pizzas and other food are good but it is quite pricey.  I may visit Mellow Mushroom only ocassionally largely due to how expensive it can get. It is also not in the best location in town so it may not be easy to come across as it is not in a heavily trafficed part of Lakeland.,2 years ago,Open,8638256000.0
