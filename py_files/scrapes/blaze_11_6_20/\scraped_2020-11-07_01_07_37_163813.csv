Claudia Lara,1.0,Food was good. The employee I had took care of me. The reason for my 1 star is because the manager(male) came in and started yelling at someone for not having the tea filled up to the top. Completely unacceptable to do in front of all your …More,a year ago,Open,310

Tanya Dempsey,1.0,"Service was abysmal. Everyone standing around doing nothing while we are waiting to order. Employees lacked even basic customer service; no smiles, no thank yous.

Eric Muenchen,1.0,Unclean! Employees were blowing their nose then serving food without washing their hands! Some employees who were handling the food weren't wearing gloves either.
