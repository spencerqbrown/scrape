Gary,1.0,"The Blaze Pizza store in Yorba Linda used to be very good. I don‚Äôt know what has happened to it lately, but I have never had two worse pizzas in my life the last two times. The last pizza had no cheese on it and was all sauce. Bring back the old Blaze Pizza. They were so bad, I don‚Äôt think I will be back.",2 months ago,Open,244
