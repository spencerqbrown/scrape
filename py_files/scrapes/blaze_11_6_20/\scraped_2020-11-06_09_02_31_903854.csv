Val Markovska,2.0,"Love Blaze pizza. Today, at the woodfield location they mixed up the sauce and was very, very spicy. They did not put a sign or let people know. We spent $20  on a 2 very spicy pizzas that went right in the trash.when we asked why the pizza is so spicy,  we were told, they were aware of the mix up and are trying to fix it. Disappointing",11 months ago,Open,155
