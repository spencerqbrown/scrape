Getwithgbandz R.,2.0,"Every time I come here, they take about seven minutes to greet us and take our order. They‚Äôre always doing online orders first priority, not the customers in the store. I‚Äôve had experience working in fast food and customers that are in store are always first priority. If you come here order on the phone or online. They take forever.",a week ago,Open,163
