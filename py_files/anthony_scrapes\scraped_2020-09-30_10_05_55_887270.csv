Edely Abreu,1.0,"This place is not a good place to order from, their customer service is lacking. I have been to other chains of Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza in the Aventura and North Miami, FL area, which I can honestly say were superb in terms of their customer service and served delicious fresh pizza. They were very attentive to their customers needs. I wanted to try this location in Ft. Lauderdale and ordered a pizza. Once I picked it up I noticed it did not have tomato sauce in it, who wants a pepperoni mozzarella cheese pizza without tomato sauce? It's just a slap of cheese on bread if you ask me. The pizza looked very dry, thus I asked if the pizza could be remade to include the sauce. I did not mind paying for the difference. However, I instead was told that there was ""nothing"" they could do and that I could order a new pizza if I wanted the problem corrected despite the fact that I had already paid $21 for this pizza. Then they suggested I take a side of tomato sauce if I'd like. Dipping my pizza in a side of tomato sauce is not what I expect when I order fresh pizza from a restaurant. I am extremely disappointed in the service I received in this location, far from what I expected.",4 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2203 S Federal Hwy FORT LAUDERDALE FL 33316-3593 (954) 462-5555

Adriana Barbieri,1.0,"Writing this for a friend of mine named Michael Moulis. He ordered the Pauli's Pie Pizza, & added Prosciutto on it as a topping. (got it from UberEats)

When the pizza arrived there was no Prosciutto. And he got charged as well.

So he called you guys up and the woman who answered said in these exact words ""we've never put Prosciutto on our pizza"" and Michael continued to say, yes you have, I've had it with my friend THE OWNER of this joint.

The lady continued to say "" he was STUPID and she was going to hang up"" because of how dumb he sounded.

This review is not to butcher UberEats ( because they actually were trying too help)

This review is for Anthony's.

This girl needs to be fired, that is completely unprofessional language.

She worked the night shift. He called at 6:58PM. We don't know what she looks like but I will find her :) and make sure to let the owner know",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2203 S Federal Hwy FORT LAUDERDALE FL 33316-3593 (954) 462-5555

Joseph D'Elia,1.0,Ive eaten at many Anthony's in South Florida but this one I had to contact corporate about.  We are an interracial couple and when we first arrived we were seated right next to the bathroom when there were many other seats available in the house.  After that it took some time for someone to come over and offer us refreshments.  Once the waitress finally came over she kept staring at us and it made us feel very uncomfortable.  It took 1 hour before I finally got upset enough to ask for a manager.  Once the manager came over she apologized that our pizza just went in the oven but patrons that came after us were eating their pizzas already.  When we asked for our check and told the manager we didnt want the pizza after the long wait there wasn't even an offer made to compensate us in any sort of way to make us feel better.  It really made us feel discriminated upon and as if they wanted us to leave anyway.

I had a large event (25 people) and called them earlier in the week to set up a reservation.  While they couldn't hold reservations for a large party like that, they did set some tables aside.

We had plenty of food for everyone, and it was outstanding: Salad, wings, meatballs, ribs, and excellent pizza.  Friendly service, great food, and can't beat the price.

I brought up to her attention that the salad was small for what I know they serve, and she just brushed me out the phone like to get me over with, As a consumer that pays $15.00 Per salad i expect for them not to be mediocre on the servings of a salad and to treat a client right if they call with a small concern like this.

My message to the woman that answered the phone today 7/30/15 at 2:35 PM is it have a little bit more of customer service, and act like you care for the business. Remember you work there.
