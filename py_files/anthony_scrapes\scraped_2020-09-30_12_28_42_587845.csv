Raj S,3.0,Loved the ambience and the food. Egg plant pizza was good but more of tomato sauce in it ..couldnt  taste the eggplant flavor much. I wish they had less paste and more eggplant ☺️  kids loved the cheese pizza though. One other issue was there was no medium size pizza.. small pizza posted around  18 and large posted 21.. so we were forced to buy large.. i wish small pizzas were less expensive .. overall it was expensive. For 2 pizzas and a drink we had to pay around 70$ .. pizzas were really good but not worth for the price. Good to go once to experience the food..,3 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 80 Parsonage Rd EDISON NJ 08837-2416 (732) 744-1500

Steve Stojanovich,5.0,"Best pizza ever? But the wings....

I’m from Buffalo. I know wings. I ordered this pizza, expecting good pizza. The pizza was excellent. But while ordering I decided to order wings, assuming they would be like all the rest in NJ - too small, breaded, greasy, or just plain awful. ESPECIALLY since Anthony’s bakes their wings. My expectations were negative. These wings are officially in my Top 5 of all time, which is serious :) great job fellas.

Lindsey Leardi,4.0,"This is my favorite chain restaurant. Whenever I'm in town Anthony's is a must-visit for me. I've been to Anthony's countless times over the last 3+ years. I love their Classic Italian Salad, Meatballs with Ricotta, and their pizzas, of course. They have great wines, sangria, and cocktails too.

It's not the cheapest place so be prepared to pay up or share pizza and apps with your group. The best deal is Wednesday's Meatballs & Martinis for $5 Martinis from 5pm to close. Join their rewards club and put your phone number on your receipt to receive points for purchases to receive money off your bill in the future.

Service is usually good. Anthony's can be busy during peak hours so it doesn't hurt to call ahead especially if you have a large groups. One time I went with a group of 9 people and they were incredibly accommodating. I called one hour ahead and by the time we got there our table was all set and ready for us. Most of the time the service is great.

They have a parking lot, so I've never had an issue with parking. Plus they are right next to Target which is convenient.",8 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 80 Parsonage Rd EDISON NJ 08837-2416 (732) 744-1500

Well, we dined Friday. I had the 6 pork ribs. Very good with a bit much rosemary. Also requested sweet peppers & onions which were very good. Individual pies all looked good but too over done for my taste. Service was super. Still way overpriced.

For 2 pizzas and a drink we had to pay around 70$ .. pizzas were really good but not worth for the price.

The pizza is ""well done"" and some might not like that it sometimes has some burnt crust. Love the sausage topping.  The pepperoni comes out crispy because the ovens are so hot!  Be sure and have some wings.  They are roasted in the extra hot coal ovens. No breading. Definitely try the eggplant marino appetizer.  it's sliced extra thin.  But ask for mozzarella on it. The salad is simple, yet delicious. Go for the Gorgonzola cheese on it, too. It mixes well with the red wine vinegar dressing.  (You don't get a dressing choice.)  If you don't want a big salad, ask for the lunch one. It's perfect for 2 to share.",3 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 80 Parsonage Rd EDISON NJ 08837-2416 (732) 744-1500

Mark Deavult,4.0,"There's an old joke that states that if you're after a great NYC pizza, either you have to go to New York, or to South Florida.

Given the diaspora of native New Yorkers to Florida, there's some truth to that. In the same way that American blues music made its journey to suburban popularity through the music scene in England, there's a parallel here where coal-fired pizza made a similar journey from NYC to Florida, then back to the suburban northeast.

The decor is a contrived combination of wood bar and carefully curated items that recall a past that never really existed, in a functional chain sort of setting. The tchotchkes are diverting, but the real star of the show is, of course, the pizza.

Now, if you're expecting five-star pizza .... ummm, no. We save those five stars for those places that are unique, original, and utterly special. But, it's a good, solid four-star pie. As advertised, it features a charred crust, that is good but missing that special something that really perfect pizza has. The sauce is slightly sweet, missing some of the tomato tang and bite you'll find in a NYC pie, but it works well in context with good quality cheese and loaded toppings.

Wisely, the menu isn't extensive, choosing to execute a narrower range of choices well, with a standout wing offering and decent meatballs.

The beer selection shines, with a good rotating selection of craft beers and occasional specials.

It's a better-than-average pizza in a nice setting next to a suburban mall and surrounded by a traffic nightmare. If shopping in the mall doesn't drive you to drink, the traffic will, so grab a seat at the bar and order a cold one. It will ease the pain.",4 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 80 Parsonage Rd EDISON NJ 08837-2416 (732) 744-1500
