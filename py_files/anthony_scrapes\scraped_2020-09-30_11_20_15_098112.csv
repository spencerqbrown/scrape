Ideally, I'd give this marvelous restaurant 4.5 stars only because they're quite pricey for pizza, even given the excellent quality. As for location and ambience, the facility is marvelous! We really enjoyed our time and relaxation. The background music was very enjoyable. The pizza was outstanding! Really one of my favorites. We really enjoyed the charred flavor of the crust and the thin texture. As mentioned, the 12"" pizza with 2 toppings was a bit pricey (if I recall $18). The grilled wings were very good, even if not the usual hot-wings I tend to prefer. Finally, the service was very good.

Take-out is remarkably expedient and you feel welcomed as a customer as soon as you walk in through the door (they have staff members waiting to open the door for you when you come in & exit). It‚Äôs a great feeling when you see managers actually hustling and working their butts off taking charge of the restaurant and doing REAL work just like the rest of their employees instead of hiding in a room somewhere or behind a computer.

Peter Sauter,4.0,"I'll say it straight away, the great taste of their food is what pushes this review to 4 (and even makes me consider 5) out of 5 stars.

TL;DR: Amazing food, neither cheap nor expensive, bad ambience and spotty service. Their other locals are infinitely better, or you can order it for takeout.

So what's the deal?
The interior of an Antony's Pizza varies from place to place. Oftentimes the interior is quite nice and well furnished, but THIS ONE is quite lackluster. The restaurant is often full (a testament to how good their food is) but the space feels very crammed. The ambient noise can get very loud, and they often play the music at a volume higher than the ambient noise (which can get to be unbearably loud). The furniture and interior design is very forgettable, and presence of TV screens in every direction makes you feel like you're at a sports bar rather than a restaurant.

The service tends to be good, although I recently had a rather odd experience with a missing object (I called, they said it wasn't there, I decided to go there in person, they said the same thing again, then I pushed the matter a little bit more, and all of a sudden the missing object appears. I hate to see the worst in people, but this was fishy...).

Last among the list, is their prices. This is the most minor of issues, seeing as the taste is top notch, but I can't help but to feel like it's a little overpriced for what it is. Maybe it's a combination of the lackluster environment with the stereotype of ""pizza must be cheap no matter what"". But I digress.

I'd recommend that anyone go to Anthony's Pizza for a great meal, any day of the week. But I'd recommend that you go to any of their other locals (the one at Coral Gables is FANTASTIC), or that you get it as takeout.",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 10205 S Dixie Hwy PINECREST FL 33156-3167 (305) 740-5800

We didn't receive our appetizer, and our wing order was wrong. But... we didn't complain, just let it be. We waited an additional 30 minutes for our pepperoni pizza, finally were able to flag down our waitress who had disappeared, and she informed us our pizza had been burned and they were remaking it. Oookay. When our pizza finally came out, our appetizer came with it... in the form of a topping on another pizzaüòë We sent that one back. Then we asked several times for napkins... she never brought them. Oh well.

The staff is always friendly and courteous at all times of your visit.  Sometimes i find that if you visit a restaurant at a non busy time, the staff tends to feel almost a bit lazy.  This couldn‚Äôt be further from the case at Anthony‚Äôs.

She had a 12 inch sausage and sweet pepper pizza, and I had their 12 inch sliced tomato, mozzarella, basil pizza (not to be confused with their margarita pizza) I added hot finger peppers which is the first time I've run into that presentation on a pizza.

Sachin Patel,3.0,"We ordered a pizza and 5 wings.
Pizza - half mushroom/olives, half spicy sausage/ricotta
Wings - 5 Anthony‚Äôs signature

The pizza was ok, the mushroom had a tang suggesting they were canned and not fresh, the olives were super salty. The sausage was tough and seemed burned. The dough was nice.

The wings were also ok, they were definitely on the saltier side but were well cooked. The onions were good too.",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 10205 S Dixie Hwy PINECREST FL 33156-3167 (305) 740-5800

louie porto,4.0,"So i went to this restaurant instead of the one on kendall drive because my daughter has never been. We order 20 wings a meatball and ricotta pizza a square cheese pizza a sparkling water a beer and two waters. For starters the waiter brings a sprite instead of the sparkling water,no big deal he corrects his mistake... everything was delicious. So we had some left over slices of pizza so we ask for them to go then he leaves to the kitchen with the leftovers and kicks the swinging kitchen doors open with his foot and drops the slices on the floor. The whole time im looking at the kitchen cause we were seated right by the register and I can see everything. The guy picks up the slices and some coworkers witness this also. So im thinking ok this guy is throwing them out and hes probably gonna apologize and maybe compensate us or do or say something about what just happened but this douchebag comes back with a box like nothing happened and denies it to my face,whats even worse is that coworkers saw this too and said nothing. This is the worst and most disgusting experience ive had in a restaurant, I will never eat there again and definitely will not recommend that location to anyone. I cant believe this kinda stuff happens and no one said anything. Manager was nice but I dont even know what to say cause that was a terrible and disgusting experience. If I didnt see it we would have eaten pizza that fell on the floor, unacceptable! UPDATE !!! I was contacted by management and everything was resolved in a professional manner and Im very pleased with the outcome,thanks.",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 10205 S Dixie Hwy PINECREST FL 33156-3167 (305) 740-5800

Maybe the pizza is woefully short of sauce, or it is undercooked, or overcooked.  It includes a topping not chosen.  One of the above and more can occur and does.  The place is usually busy and hectic, so when you are asked to check out your pizzas on a very crowded, busy floor, before leaving, it can be rather hard to confirm that they are adequate.  And besides, it is their job to ensure quality, and as pizza goes even in Miami, they are not inexpensive!
