Henrietta Woods,5.0,Restaurant was not busy. We were a big group with children and were seated promptly. We ordered wings and meatballs as appetizers and both were excellent. I'm not a big fan of meatballs but I have to say I loved this ones. Wings were very tasty with lots of meat. The pizza is thin crust which is not my favorite but I can say It was delicious. They have a good selection of beers. Also. they have a happy hour but you need to be seating in the bar to enjoy the offer.,a month ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 11037 Pines Blvd PEMBROKE PINES FL 33026-5217 (954) 443-6610

If you are looking for good  tasty flavors this is not the place.
I would suggest this place to friends that want o eat enough, because the portions are quite larger or at least it feels that way.
The price is fare comparing the amount of food you are getting.
Service is fine
Salad was fine
Pizza was ok

Matt,5.0,"Just relocated from Tampa, so decided to try a familiar place and it was very consistent experience in both locations. Excellent service, prompt, friendly, Gabrielle was knowledgeable about menu and other servers were quick to help pre-bus tables, seat guests, etc.  Good teamwork!

Pizza of course great.   They do it ‚Äòwell done‚Äô AS IT SHOULD BE...and we ask for it a bit MORE we‚Äôll done as u can see in pics.  Pizza is about the dough and it‚Äôs flavorful, just enough‚Äô hew‚Äô and the char!  Ingredients are fresh...we love the Italian long peppers for some kick!

Charles Wen,4.0,"So this time I tried the Anthony's in Pembroke Pines. Service, as always, is very attentive, plates are fired quickly, waiter was present without being obtrusive. Light should be regulated better as there were no shades to moderate the glare from outside. I had the Italian spring salad. The chicken tasted bought cooked and not freshly made. Highly salted, like a cold cut. The rest of the salad was fine. We also ordered a square margherita pizza, tasty. We had the meatballs for appetizer and they did not disappoint. The one low point, though, the hostess in her quickness to seat someone almost knocked our pizza peel off its stand and did not come back to apologize. It is not a large complaint, but it is not in step with the obviously superior training that Anthony's implements.",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 11037 Pines Blvd PEMBROKE PINES FL 33026-5217 (954) 443-6610

Michael Ramsey,5.0,"Update JUL9:
Uber Eats was awesome. It can be kind of tricky with some of the limitations on the app. It is not ACFP fault. They are the best see the latest pic.

Love this pizza. Coal fired hearth. The crust is crisp no matter what size you get with a great bite and chew. Ask for the vinegar peppers if you like hot pickled peppers. They are cherry peppers which you might find about 30% of the time in a pizza shop.

Josie H,5.0,"After picking up my youngest daughter from school, I decided to treat her to pizza at Anthony's. Located in the Pembroke Lakes Square plaza, this location is large with plenty of indoor/outdoor seating, as well as seating by the bar. The restaurant has a casual sporty feel to it with photos of athletes/celebrities and flat screen tvs adorning the walls. It wasn't that busy so we were told to sit anywhere.

A few minutes later our server, Eric, arrived and took our order of soft drinks and two personal pizzas - cheese and Philly cheesesteak. The pizzas arrived about 10-15 minutes and they both looked delicious. It was my daughter's first time eating coal fire pizza and after finishing off three slices, I can tell she enjoyed it. My Philly cheesesteak pizza was amazing. The flavors of the cheese, pieces of steak, and onions complemented each other nicely. Eric was very friendly and checked on us in a timely manner making sure things were to our liking.

When I asked the server what was in the salad before I even ordered it she said there was lettuce tomato onion olives, I asked for no olives but there was also chickpeas and celery which I did not care for and did not expect.

If you are a cheese lover, add gorgonzola. Yes, it's a little expensive, but worth it, IMO. You must try their wings as well. Yummy! I suggest eating in.

Ordered a small mozzarella and cheese salad,  only 2 slices of cheese and 2 thick slices of tomatos and they threw in some green and red peppers, which I did not asked for and the green peppers turned out to be really spicy.  I cannot eat nor enjoy spicy food of any kind.  Worst thing is to try something and not knowing it's going to burn your mouth.  Not satisfy with the taste or how it was cooked.  What a waste of $30.00.  Will not be ordering from them again.  First and last time.",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 11037 Pines Blvd PEMBROKE PINES FL 33026-5217 (954) 443-6610

Robert Riley,4.0,"We went in on a Saturday night.  We waited over 30 minutes to get a pizza.  The wait time was the only negative thing.  The pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  I will definitely be going back.  Service was a little slow.  They didn't come back very often to ask if everything was okay.  The drinks are served in bottles instead of fountain.  I like fountain drinks better.  Menu is a little weak on selection.  I've been to other places that serve Italian food that offer much more food to eat, but the pizza there is still out of this world.",9 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 11037 Pines Blvd PEMBROKE PINES FL 33026-5217 (954) 443-6610

quincy nwamah,1.0,I don't understand the critical acclaim this restaurant chain receives. The Pizza is horribly charred and tastes like freshly burned coal.
