Angie Alvarado,5.0,Restaurant was not busy. We were a big group with children and were seated promptly. We ordered wings and meatballs as appetizers and both were excellent. I'm not a big fan of meatballs but I have to say I loved this ones. Wings were very tasty with lots of meat. The pizza is thin crust which is not my favorite but I can say It was delicious. They have a good selection of beers.

Voodoo 5.2 Performance,5.0,"IMPRESSED! We were meeting some friends who were staying in Broward, so we chose this Anthony's as a mid-point for both parties. We called ahead to be placed on the waitlist for our party of six and it was all set when we arrived. We were greeted promptly by Frank, who we later learned was the manager. He had our table ready and we were seated immediately with all social distancing measures applied. Hal was our server and he was WONDERFUL! He got us our drinks while we perused the online menu and when we were ready, took our order, all memorized with ZERO errors. We received our order shortly after and it was DELICIOUS. We ordered several pies, wings, and a salad and everything tasted great. Hal made sure our drinks were topped off each time he came by our table and Frank came by to ask how everything was as well. We could NOT have asked for a better experience! We live 40 minutes away from this Anthony's and our family agreed that it is worth the drive. This will be our go-to Anthony's moving forward. The service, the food and the safety measures were all on point. Thank you Frank and Hal for making us feel like we were the only guests in the entire restaurant. The attention and the service did not go unnoticed. We were so sad only half a pie was leftover for us to enjoy at lunch the next day! But...we will see you again next week for pizza night!!",3 weeks ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 3111 SW 160th Ave MIRAMAR FL 33027-4214 (954) 392-3811
Thiago Vicente,5.0,"Before I start this review I need to say that they have the best pizza in town.
I‚Äôve ordered online throughout their website for a delivery, as I‚Äôm long time customer, particularly from this location, I‚Äôve never had a problem before.
So, they did use DoorDash to provide their deliveries. As I was tracking my food, it showed that it was delivered. I waited few more minutes till I reach out DoorDash. The representative told me that I should contact the restaurant since it was a service that they‚Äôre using from DoorDash. Right, what it is the restaurant problem when you charge a fee plus tip from the Driver?
Anyway I‚Äôve called the restaurant and merged the call with DoorDash rep.
The manager Frank, from Anthony told us that he personally handled the food to the driver but the rep mentioned that he couldn‚Äôt track him. Immediately Frank offered to make a new order and asked if I was able to pick it up.
That being said, I would like to give Frank a judo to handle this situation very professionally and make sure I will get my food as soon as they could.
Thanks Anthonys for a delicious meal.
Thank you Frank for your service.

Pizza was excellent and they offer a deliciously strong IPA called Lucifer. The service was outstanding as I had the good fortune of having Frank C as my server. Frank is courteous, friendly and interacted well with guests. You can't go wrong here, although I would say that their beer needs to be a little colder, especially if they aren't serving hard liquor and it just goes well with the hot summer heat. üòé
