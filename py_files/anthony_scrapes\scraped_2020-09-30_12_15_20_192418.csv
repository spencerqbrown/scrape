Steven Glaser,2.0,"Staff was very nice and I almost feel bad leaving this review, but the pizza was genuinely terrible :(

Pizza was burnt, there was WAY to much pepper, there were large chunks of onion, and very little sausage on my sausage, pepper, and onion pizza.

For $24 for a 12"" pizza with 3 toppings I expected great pizza. Instead I received the opposite. It seems like there are many 5 star reviews so I'm sure this was a fluke, but boy were we disappointed.",2 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 48 Walkers Brook Dr READING MA 01867-3224 (781) 944-8454

Brynn Rowe,1.0,"I wanted to love this place and I'm hoping we just caught them on a bad night but my square margherita pizza was soggy and our pepperoni pizza was missing the char. We waited excessively long for our food, for our appetizer dishes to be cleared and for drinks to be filled. I'm assuming we should have had separate appetizer plates that could've been cleared before our pizzas arrived but we were only given dinner plates. I had to put my pizza in the remaining sauce from the meatball appetizer. While our waitress refilled drinks for half of our party the other half sat with empty glasses through multiple of her visits to the table. She also didn't seem to realize that the stacked appetizer dishes and empty cups could have been removed from the table until we handed them to her. Another waitress stated that we looked ready and sought out our waitress thinking we were ready to leave. In fact we were still waiting for our food but overcrowded by the empty cups and appetizer platters. It was an expensive bill for mediocre food and poor service.",8 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 48 Walkers Brook Dr READING MA 01867-3224 (781) 944-8454

It was really reflected in the quality of the pizza.

Twice now I've ordered through Grubhub, and the GrubHub drivers haven't even bothered to deliver my food. I then called the restaurant, and Dillian personally had the pizzas remade, and delivered them personally. This is what going beyond what's necessary is. 1000% recommended.",2 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 48 Walkers Brook Dr READING MA 01867-3224 (781) 944-8454

Found the pizza to be on the pricey side. Wings, as well, were overpriced. This place did have a really good selection of local craft beer, which surprised me.

If I was hungry again after furniture shopping, I might come back here. But I'd be equally tempted to just opt for a quick burrito next door at Chipotle.",4 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 48 Walkers Brook Dr READING MA 01867-3224 (781) 944-8454

John Lambert,3.0,"This is really a mixed review. My service was excellent, the food came out quickly and was really hit or miss.  The chicken wings were a bit bland and a bit charred. I could not really tell if they even salt and peppered them. I don't think they were.  The house salad with chick peas was ok.  I ordered the square Sicilian pizza. The small was $18. I guess for it being called Sicilian I expected it to be a thicker crust. It's a thin crust margarita, very tasty, but really not an $18 pizza.  This was way over priced and not really Sicilian.  The steak and cheese pizza was pretty yummy.  The white pizza was bland.  This place does have craft beers and that's plus.  Only 1 desert available.

Would I go out of my way to return there?  I don't think so.  One item that I would try if I returned was their meatballs.  The red sauce was tasty so maybe I could try another visit if I am out that way again.",3 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 48 Walkers Brook Dr READING MA 01867-3224 (781) 944-8454
