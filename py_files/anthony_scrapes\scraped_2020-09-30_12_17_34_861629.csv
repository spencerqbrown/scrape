Milton White III,1.0,"I am pleased with the food. Well seasoned, cooked well. I have visited the Wynnewood location for just about 1  year after meeting at one of your former bartenders at ""not your average Joe's"" who recommended your store. Since then, there has been a constant change of managers and staff. Most were very accommodating, professional and friendly. Recently, I have feel that my business is not
appreciated, by the bar staff. As often as I have frequented, and tipped no less than 20%, many times more, they have no greeting or conversation for me. Yet, a few times that I visited, they've given more attention to others that they obviously have given more time to get to know them. Yet, I have been there with no one else there around and have not been given any attention other than placing my order. The owners are in town this week, and I'm sure that this particular person will one be ""on"" for ""show"" but I am now no longer a fan of this establishment.

Bill Flynn,1.0,We have been eating at Anthony's since not long after the Exton location opened. We love the pizza.  Today's visit in Wynnewood was very disappointing. The main issue was the poor service. There were at least 6 people on the wait staff and only two other tables occupied. One with 4 people and one with a single. Plus one person at the bar. So you would assume there would be no delays. You would be wrong!  Then there was the pizza. For some reason the cook decided it needed an extra health dose of pepper.

Lily Ofthevalley,1.0,"We were brave and tried a new restaurant. I get that it‚Äôs a sports bar,very noisy. I liked the arugula pizza but my gut was cramping  after eating it,  I asked the waiter for oregano  and he said there was no oregano it was ‚Äúcorporate policy‚Äú my husband and I are still joking about that! And I thought about popping over to giant to buy a jar of oregano to put on my pizza .  My merlot wine cost about 9.50 and tasted like vinegar so I had 3 sips,left the rest.  That‚Äôs probably my fault as the waiter offered me a chance to taste it. Be sure to taste the wine!But I thought at an Italian restaurant they would have decent wine.  My husband with ‚Äúno taste buds‚Äù didn‚Äôt like the crust on his cheesesteak pizza, he only ate a few slices. The brocolli rabe I ordered was heavily dosed with red pepper flakes, too spicy and I was expecting fresh garlic. I sent it back and they nicely brought me another one with les spice but the rabe had been boiled to death and had no bite and no discernible fresh garlic. It‚Äôs supposed to be lightly blanched. I took a small bite and  I told the waiter but he did not take the broccoli Rabe off the check. It was 71$ with tip for two people which is fine if you love the food. We won‚Äôt go back. A restaurant has one chance to get it right. And they did not get it right.",2 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 50 East Wynnewood Road WYNNEWOOD PA 19096 (610) 645-5453

A couple times I tried to get her attention and she l know that she saw me ( as I was trying to get her attention)  and she turned and walked away ...I saw her reaction to other customers and she seemed pleasant to then but to us..Not so much ..Our order was simple and we didn't ask for much and when she brought it to the table I said thank you  to which I got no reply( after about the 3rd thank you for bringing us our soda and napkins we finally got a reply)  . When we were finished eating I had a slice of pizza left When she asked me if I want to wrap it up I said yes( I would have been ok with a box being brought to me) she grabbed my plate with the pizza slice on it proceeds to place the used napkins and silverware from off table on my plate of pizza to be wrapped ...Needless to to say she returns with the wrapped pizza in the box and I decided to leave it on the table . She said have a good night but I am not sure if she meant it ..Overall I would say the place was ok but I didn't feel. welcomed until we were leaving to which 3 of the employees said have a good night which was nice ...I know you are thinking ""Maybe she was having an bad day?""

rich cutshall,3.0,"Ok, I am going to try their pizza.  They have motivated me to try pizza again in the Philly area, which is a pizza desert, just by installing coal ovens. Philly made thin New York style is typically slapped together, tasteless and on some sort of mega-gluten rubber disk pretending to be a crust. Forget Chicago style, simplest pie in the world to make well but not here, no, it's NOT ok to use more of that same rubber compound in a dish and call it deep-dish or Chicago style. All that said, I am heading out to get one of these coal fired pies and the next paragraphs will tell the tale:  Dozens of possible missteps, but only one way to glory...  Give a damn about your product, craft each pie like it will raise the human spirit and singlehandedly bring about world peace.

So, here's the skinny, everything you are about to learn about Anthony's must be viewed through the prism of price. This is the single most expensive pizza I have ever eaten, period. John's coal fired pizza in the East Village costs less and delivers more, but that's to be expected from the best of the best. $29 bucks for a 12"" two topping pie and a side salad with no dressing.

Bottom line, best crust outside NYC. Flaccid sauce, I ordered onions which were curious, honestly I think they were Sabrett hotdog onions cooked in sauce. The pepperoni was generous, but had very little flavor (if you want really good Pepperoni on the second best crust outside the five boros get a pie from Conti's in Princeton).  The cheese was excellent, well balanced with the pie and expertly baked.

There's no way to get to five stars with a pie this expensive unless it's perfect, two star Michelin perfect. The artsy-fartsy onions and Pizza Hut pepperoni won't make anyone happy, so three stars it is.

Expect excellent service; attentive, intelligent and insightful. Expect an excellent pie and a crisp fresh salad. Expect to pay an unusual amount for it all, and I guess be thankful you didn't have to drive to the big apple to get it?",3 years ago-,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 50 East Wynnewood Road WYNNEWOOD PA 19096 (610) 645-5453
