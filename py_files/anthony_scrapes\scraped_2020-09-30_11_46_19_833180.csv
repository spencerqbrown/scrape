India Washington,4.0,We ordered over the phone for fast pick up and the first pizza we ordered was a bit burnt.  I checked it once I got to the car and realized it was burnt and took it back in to explain and that we would like another pizza.  The gentleman said it's not burnt its just the crust.  I was shocked at first.  Because when you are paying for your food you should be able to eat every part of it not something that is burnt.  However be did ask if I wanted a new pizza and I said yes and another was made.  I give 4 stars because he looked at the pizza lifted it up and said it wasn't burnt when it was an then I can't eat it after he touched it with his bare hands.  This was my second time at this location.  I would give it another chance,a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2045 MacKenzie Way CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP PA 16066-5337 (724) 742-1212

Tom Haley,1.0,"Friday night, was my wife's birthday. Ordered a small margarita pizza and a large sausage/ mushroom. Also ordered 10 wings. They said it would be an hour to pick up. Was there in 65 minutes.  Got home with the food and only got 5 wings, not the 10 that I ordered. The pizza was cold and flavorless. My bill was 73.00! Everyone at are little party said any  one of the cheaper delivery chains are better... and significantly less money.
Not only was the pizza cold and flavorless, the crust was undercooked. Very disappointing, I will never go back.",4 days ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2045 MacKenzie Way CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP PA 16066-5337 (724) 742-1212

C M,1.0,"Overpriced IMO, and burnt. I ordered a 12 inch, 3 topping pizza: $18.99 plus tax. I can get the same pizza for $15 or less.  The pizza place closest to me charges $11.75 for the same thing. Additionally, the crust was burnt. I couldn't eat the all of it and had to throw out the burned portions.  Coal fired shouldn't mean burned, black, or covered in coal. I should still be able to eat what I ordered, especially at a premium price.",a month ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2045 MacKenzie Way CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP PA 16066-5337 (724) 742-1212

Bob Porter,2.0,"Food was okay. We had called ahead to see if they did rehearsal dinners. Since I have several family members with celiac disease, I specifically asked about GF options. I was assured there would be some, so we went to check the place out. Turns out that there are no entrees available that are gluten free. Only appetizers and salads. And the staff didn’t seem to have any idea what items were gluten free or could be modified.

We had decided to sit on the patio and about halfway through our meal, the sun started to beat down on me and I asked the waitress if the sunshade behind me could be pulled down. The guy who came over told me it was a “complicated process” to get them down and that it wouldn’t have helped anyway. Even though everything at the table next to us was effectively shaded by a pulled down sunshade. So...yes, it would have helped. Very obvious laziness.

I try my hardest not to complain because I know things happen and foodservice is a very difficult job. But the disorganization and lack of courtesy really left a bad taste in my mouth.

allison,3.0,"I never liked margherita pizza until I had Anthony's Square Margherita Pizza. That has now changed. The last two times we ordered it it was burnt and very chewy. Granted the edges on this type of pizza should be slightly burnt but not to this degree. This time it was much smaller than it should have been, they obviously didn't stretch out the dough enough.   Also the chef just threw a sprig of basil on opposite corners. Before, when I got good pizza from Anthony's, the basil would come in a small cup so you could add it on to your liking but this time it was added before it was cooked. So I also got burnt basil. Yum. I am extremely disappointed, I absolutely loved this pizza; now I'm having an internal struggle. Should I give them one more chance with the three strikes you're out rule or fool me once shame on you, fool my twice shame on me? I still gave it three stars because if made correctly the food is amazing and maybe the chef that made our last two pizzas is going through a tough time. We all go through them, it's cool. You made amazing pizzas once, you're capable of many other amazing things. Realize that so you can go back to making amazing pizzas.",2 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 2045 MacKenzie Way CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP PA 16066-5337 (724) 742-1212

ed musthaler,2.0,"Maybe my expectations were too high. I'm the kind of person who has driven to new york for a weekend primarily for the pizza. Brooklyn, soho any new york hand tossed pizza is worth the trip to me. So after my first experience today with anthonys it became very clear that this is a chain restaurant. The sauce didn't pop, not bad but boring. The crust was too thick for this style and the toppings only went out 1.5 inches from the edge. The edge crust didn't have any light and airy bubles that I expect from hand tossed crust, which makes me think this crust was pressed by machine. Shame. And there was no olive oil sprinkled on top. The pepperoni was good. Thats about the only above average thing I can say about it. This chain will linger for some years catering to the ""don't know any better"" crowd, but the world needs better than this.
