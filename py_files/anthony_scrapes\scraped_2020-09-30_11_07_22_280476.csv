If you are looking for thd best, least fattening, and healthy pizza then this is the place that you would love to go to. The best thing that keeps me going back to this place for the last 12 and recommending it to people are the caramelized wings, the atmosphere, and the service. Amazing place to go and have a nice conversation, nice and romantic atmosphere and date, and just to have an IPA or a glass of wine.",a month ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 8031 Turkey Lake Rd ORLANDO FL 32819-7384 (407) 363-9466

It was nothing sort of good service and amazing food. One most try their house meatballs. The bread that comes it. It is phenomenal. It’s soft  and very flavorful. The pizzas are also incredibly good. The only down side to this location is the lack of serving stronger alcohol. The wines and beers are decent with a large variety of each but  other stronger.

Robb Alvey,2.0,"I hate having to leave a 2-star review for a place that we normally love but unfortunately our experience today was a 2-star review.  The wings here are our favorite ""non-buffalo"" style wings anywhere.  When we have ordered them in the past, they have arrived to our table blazing hot, fresh right out of the oven and full of flavor.

Today, I ordered the 20-wings as my main course, and when they arrived, they were lukewarm and tasted like they had been sitting out for a while.

We have been to Anthony's quite a bit, and this was probably our 2nd or 3rd visit since they have re-opened, but today was the first time we were truly disappointed.

We only ended up eating five of the twenty wings and our server didn't even make any mention or ask if anything was wrong.  I'm not the type of person to be confrontational or send something back, but had they asked I would have honestly said I was disappointed.  I would think a good server should at least ask someone why they only ate 1/4 of their meal, especially when they purposely order the larger quantity option, but that's just me.

I'm hoping that our next visit will allow me to bump this review from a 2-star up to a 4-star which is where I feel the quality of their food & service usually is.",2 weeks ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 8031 Turkey Lake Rd ORLANDO FL 32819-7384 (407) 363-9466

Blake R,5.0,"Last night, Sunday, May 10, I arrived at your location at 9:01 p.m. Saw on the inside that the store was most likely closed but there were 2 employees still inside. I called to verify closure and was told in a very polite and professional manager that they were. Now here comes the magic, outcomes a friendly gentleman named and excuse my spelling but his name was Neal. Could be spelled differently but he wanted to verify that I wasn't part of an Uber pick-up. Let him know and he asked if I was the gentleman who called recently. After acknowledging my call I let  him know about your amazing and always delicious standout wings but would be sure to be back tomorrow the 11th.

Next thing I know Mr. Neal asks me to hold on for a second and proceeds to ask Hector who I assume was the chef/grill master/wing slinging God on a grill a question I could not hear. Next thing I know Mr. Neal is packaging up a box of something for takeout. Neal proceeds to walk out of the shop and personally hand it to me and tells me to enjoy my night. After refusing my card payment for the box of wings multiple times he just states that you came all this way for our wings and I wanted to make sure you had an amazing night. In all my years of traveling and eating throughout the U.S and abroad have, I received such service. Your location has always treated me like family when I came in many years ago.

Robert Lapp,3.0,I’ve had a lot of Margarita Pizzas over the years and this one was the worst. It was dry and had little flavor. I’ve eaten here a number of times and it is a fine Italian joint but the Margarita is not good and the prices are too high. $26+ dollars for a 16” Margarita with anchovies on the side. Way too expensive. I can not justify going here anymore.,9 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 8031 Turkey Lake Rd ORLANDO FL 32819-7384 (407) 363-9466

Stephen Marquez,5.0,"11/16/19 update - Today when we entered they were not super busy and we were greeted fairly quickly and seated. And then things went a little sideways. At least two tables that were seated after us were waited on while we were sitting and waiting. Finally the hostess who seated us came over, apologized and said they were a little busy so she took our drink and food order. While we were in the restaurant they did get really busy. Beyond getting our food our service was a bit lax.

Our food arrived in a timely manner with our dry rub #2 wings arriving first. They had an excellent flavor and came with some celery and  sweet pepper all on a small bed of lettuce with a sort of cucumber ranch dip on the side. When we were just about done with the wings our pizza arrived. We ordered the Paulie's Pie with half sweet peppers and half hot peppers. I had them clarify which side had hot peppers and which had sweet peppers. The hot peppers. While not what I am used to they were very good and not overpoweringly hot. They called them finger peppers and they were fairly large and baked perfectly on the pizza. I waited an unusually long time to get a refill on my drink but they were very quick to bring us our check and process it. While this is not the standard of service I am used to from here they did get everything done and the food was excellent as usual.

We have been here something like 4 times over the last few years (we don't live too close). The food is always good and the service is always friendly. Try one of their specialty pizzas if you can't make up your mind. The meatball and mozzarella is excellent.",10 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 8031 Turkey Lake Rd ORLANDO FL 32819-7384 (407) 363-9466

The crust is thin but substantial, plum tomatoes define the sauce and the well doneness is something you will only try to find elsewhere (good luck with that).

james richie,3.0,So we were in the Orlando area on vacation. Being from the New York   metropolitan area it's hard to find good pizza when out of the northeast. I read all the reviews and decide to order 2 pies for take out. They were ok not as great as the hipe according to the reviews.  I'm convinced it's just Florida. Nobody can make a good pizza in this state. Maybe it's the humidity I dont know. These guys try to make these fancy pies but they tasted just like the one I bought for the kids in the hotel commissary I was staying at in universal.  sorry guys I wasn't impressed. I will say however the place looked nice and the employees were very professional. Service however only takes you so far when the product is mediocre.  They should come up to the northeast and see what great pizza taste like.

Scott Buie,1.0,"So, I've gotten pizza from Anthony's a couple of times, and although it's never been terrific, it's always been decent.  My Wife ordered a 12"" Margherita, extra crispy,  on her way home from work tonight, and had a glass of wine while it was being cooked.  So far, so good.  She got it when it was done and headed home.  I had preheated the oven to 350, so we could make sure it was nice and warm.  So, we heated it for about 10 minutes while we made a salad.  We sat down on the couch with our pizza and fixings, and watched something on the DVR.  Opened the box and put a slice on my plate.  It didn't look quite right.  It had a ton of cheese on it, which is odd for a Margherita pizza, and the color was off.  I pulled back the 1/4"" layer of cheese only to notice that not only was the pizza not extra crispy, the dough was raw.  That was particularly odd, because there was no sauce!  Instead of a Margherita, they gave us a fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil pizza, but somehow they even missed the basil.  A second glance at the pizza showed that the crust had a very light brown area in just a couple of small sections, so the crust was obviously WAY undercooked.  Definitely one of the worst pizzas I've had.",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 8031 Turkey Lake Rd ORLANDO FL 32819-7384 (407) 363-9466

Gabe Medina,4.0,"If you've never tried coal fired pizza, you definitely should! I've researched the differences between wood and coal fire, and neither are necessarily better than the other; it's just different. Coal provides a more even hear and the pizzas can be cooked ""well-done"" with a burnt edge, and is very delicious. Wood is more traditional obviously.

The service has always been great here, and I've definitely been able to eat a half large pizza on my own. Stay with traditional toppings to get a taste of the well-done flavor first, then come back for different favors and toppings. Also, they serve Bellini here. Yum! :)",4 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 8031 Turkey Lake Rd ORLANDO FL 32819-7384 (407) 363-9466

Peter Zimmer,2.0,"Honestly this place came highly recommended by a friend. Not impressed. Food was greasy and not even better than pizza hut. Soda is served by the bottle, no tap options which is neither cost effective or convenient for the customer.

Location is in good order. Upscale decor and an old vintage feeling is the theme. Biggest problem is the major firecode violation, back door emergency exit and fire extinguisher are both blocked by extra tables and chairs stacked on top of each other (obviously the extra storage space).

Overall, not impressed and will not return. Too many other better pizza options in the area and for a better price.",4 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 8031 Turkey Lake Rd ORLANDO FL 32819-7384 (407) 363-9466

The tiny pizza was also not cooked properly burned on one side and also nearly $20. Upon being informed of the burned calzone the waiter told us that next time we should order it to be lightly toasted and that unless the calzone is cooked to the point where it is burned the center is not cooked properly. I have been eating calzones for decades and I have never heard or seen anything like this in my life.

Alaina DeBernardis,5.0,"I'm from S. Fla so I've been a fan of Anthony's food (starting with Anthony's runway 84) for as long as I can remember! I loved Anthony's Coal Fire pizza from the first bite I had when living down in S. Fla! Then when I moved back to Orlando you can imagine my excitement when they opened up a location right down the street from me (near the Millenia mall was their first location). I'm pretty sure we ordered from there every single Sunday (to watch the Dolphins of course)! We've literally tried everything off their menu and have NEVER once been disappointed. EVER! The food is so good, so authentic (and I'm Italian so I am picky) and the staff is always so friendly! When the Millenia location closed we didn't mind too much bc they opened their location in Dr. Phillips so we just drive there to get our fix! We probably order from there at least once every 10 days! Can't get enough of their salads and that special dressing!! We've now started buying bottles of the salad dressing to use at home. The obsession is real b/c the food is that good! By far the best pizza in town, and in all of FL!!!",4 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 8031 Turkey Lake Rd ORLANDO FL 32819-7384 (407) 363-9466

Marjorie Welsh,1.0,"Stopped by the Turkey Lake location yesterday around noon.What they serve tabelside must be much better than what they put in a to-go box.  I've never had a problem with other pizzas so I didn't think to check the box before leaving. What I found when I opened the box was a pizza with a blackened crust. It wasn't just a corner, it was black all the way around and on the bottom.

I pulled off the crust and tried to eat the pizza. The sauce seems like something I'd like except for being ruined by the scorched taste of the crust. The mushroooms were fresh and plentiful.

That the kitchen ever let this get put into a box shows me a lack of respect for the cutomer. Maybe those boxes stacked up in the kitchen and visible from the moment you walk in the door, are all just for show,

If you like blackened pizza give Anthony's a try.",10 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 8031 Turkey Lake Rd ORLANDO FL 32819-7384 (407) 363-9466
