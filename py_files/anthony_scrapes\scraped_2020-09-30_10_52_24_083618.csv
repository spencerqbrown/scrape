Great crust and sauce, well balanced by the cheese and pepperoni on ours.

And that’s sad because you’re not cooking anything...you’re just cutting things up and putting them in a container. It would be nice if it was bigger with a variety of more things to eat in it.

Paige,4.0,"Generally very consistent ... and overall pretty good.

Even during COVID, they have been terrific about following mask rules.  They stop anyone from coming in without a mask or reservation ... can attest that only patrons sitting at seats are not wearing masks as usual .. they are not required.  So not sure I agree with the prior review.  All Anthonys workers are wearing masks and gloves.

Their wings are great .. but only when John cooks them!!

Love Anthonys and everyone working there.

Not 5 stars because a 5 star review from me means the food, service, and full experience is absolutely perfect every time... Anthinys is pretty close behind.",2 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 4805 Limestone Rd WILMINGTON DE 19808-1902 (302) 635-7013

Guys. I love that you added short ribs to your menu. But have you tasted them!?  It's like eating dried out beef jerkey. Sauce has potential. Please find a different meat vendor. Seriously gagged on them tonight. Sorry.

-------------------------------------

Food is pretty good and mostly consistent.

But I'm thinking that the reason my orders on Wednesday nights are often wrong is because your severs can't hear what I'm saying!  Your live music is too loud!  You aren't a music venue.  Please turn it down.

Also, 40% of my wings were severely burnt and 20% didn't have any meat !!  They were slivers of a chicken wing.

Before eating here, I had been told that the meatballs were out of this world. They were...good.

The first time we went to Anthony's,  we were told that there would be a 40 minute wait. While this turned out to be too long, I took it as a good sign that the demand was so high, but quite honestly, I'm left shrugging my shoulders and wondering why.

ashley ward,1.0,"Cauliflower pizza was great. Sucks because i probably won't be returning to the one on limestone road. It's pretty evident that ""my kind"" (black) aren't welcomed or they aren't used to seeing us there often. My first visit amd i waited at the door for 7 minutes before even being greeted to be seated, mind you there were maybe 6 patron's there. Then once seated and i place my order, my waitress stared at me for awhile and then once i received my food, she almost NEVER came back to check on me to see if i needed anything.  I needed water refilling and i was looking for some garlic. She came back then just looked at me and checked on the other 2 tables around me quite a few times and STILL never asked me did I need anything. She didn't come back til i was completely finished eating. I can't believe i tipped her $5 bucks. But if i didn't it would've been a stigma that we don't tip. I hate to think that something's are related to race, but when i peep that everyone else who is not black is being served properly and i get ignored, it makes me wonder. Maybe she thought i wasn't from the area. I live right down the street in hockessin.

After being seated, no one approached our table for 10 minutes to take our drink orders or quite frankly, to simply introduce themselves as our waiter.

At last, a waitress came by and took our orders. She did not bother to introduce herself and we didn’t see her again til the food came out. Then we didn’t see her again til she refilled my cup, and then when we flagged her down for the check. No questions on how the food was or anything.
