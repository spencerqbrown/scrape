LEZ NMC,5.0,"I'm a new resident in the area. We prefer local pizza places and I was really excited when I found out this place is two minutes from my house. The first time I ordered it was they their website, door dash delivered it. It got here on time and it was the best pizza I had had in years. The second time I ordered for pick up. When I got home the order was wrong. And although the store is super close, cmon, who wants to get back in their car again while the other stuff gets cold? I called them and they gave me to option of going back up there to get another order which meant having to wait another 30 min or have a pie on credit. I appreciated that they even gave me an option. I chose the credit and we did what we could with the order we had. When I called up to place an order I mentioned my name and a few brief details about last time and they knew exactly who I was. I sent my boyfriend to pick up the order and he said he was approached by Austin the manager who was very apologetic and more than willing to serve us again. This was really good customer service. The pizza is always delicious and I will definitely be exploring more of their menu.",a week ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 420 E Altamonte Dr ALTAMONTE SPRINGS FL 32701-4659 (407) 260-2625

Responsible after that. They said they had no way of tracking the delivery guy to find out what happened

Now for the important part; the food. The meatballs were moist and flavorful while the sauce balanced with them perfectly. We had a plain cheese pizza which was to DIE for. The slightly charred crust mixed with dollops of sauce was a perfect combo.

Wild Journeys,1.0,"BEWARE: Loyal customers read this carefully - Extremely disappointing, and it was not the food or staff.

The corporate office decided to use this particular restaurant as a pilot for a stripped-down ACFP take-out pizza joint. The entire bar is gone. There are only two choices of beer (Miller Lite and Peroni) if you choose to stay and sit at one of the remaining tables, which I did, you can't even get a cappuccino or a slice of cheese cake. The pictures, lighting and overall  ambiance are no longer there. Gone. They even removed the pictures in the bathrooms. The music volume gets louder and quieter on its own and the staff has been decimated. There is no longer table service, you order at the front desk. They bring it to you. It was a cruel bait and switch.

After 10 years of loyalty to ACFP in Ft. Lauderdale, Plantation, Coral Springs, Wellington and Sand Lake I am shocked my favorite all time location is less than half the wonderful memory making place it was for me and my friends. I even planned to eat there this Wednesday night with my family and next week during one of my many business luncheons  throughout the year (I travel from downtown Orlando). Not any longer. I can't, it doesn't exist. It will be hard for me to eat there again. I will likely not be ordering take-out from the stripped-down facade either.

I have spent thousands of dollars for more than a decade and now there is nothing. As loyal customers there was no attempt to contact the local patrons to the changes. Nothing.

In time, alcohol sales will plummet (I am sure they have) and the Altamonte ACFP will become confused with the pizza joint across the street named - Anthony's. Corporate has rolled the dice, but my guess is they may have jumped the shark on this one.

If they reopen the full bar and restore table service, I will definitely be back, but otherwise it will be a rare occasion. Sand Lake or perhaps Tampa, I hope.",a month ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 420 E Altamonte Dr ALTAMONTE SPRINGS FL 32701-4659 (407) 260-2625

Mark Pafford,5.0,"I‚Äôve been eating at ACFP for years. Ft. Lauderdale, Plantation, Coral Springs, Wellington or Orlando - all outstanding food and excellent atmosphere. However the best location in at least the State of Florida is in Altamonte! Not only are the recipes consistent, the Marino or cauliflower come out the way you expect them to.  The menu is outstanding.

A new twist is this: The entire COVID-19 thing has transformed them into a safety first eatery. They use masks and gloves and take care to maintain social distancing wherever possible. When Florida began to open back up my first experience in a restaurant was at the Altamonte location. They were wearing masks right from the start. Annie was especially cognizant and focused on our happiness and safety. Ask for her by name - she will be happy to greet you and if she is managing you‚Äôll be even more pleased.

They have a new general manager there too. This guy always says hello and always is cheerful and friendly. He keeps a good solid crew in place. He works with the cook and doesn‚Äôt seem to be hesitant about getting his hands dirty. The guy busts his rear. Make sure you ask if Austin is managing. He may be in the back but I doubt it. He kills it!

Two more people make the place outstanding. Gabbie rocks and hustles. And finally, Scott when he is in is great. Once they open the bar I‚Äôll take my seat and look forward to talking to him. Great human being and another example as to why Altamonte is the finest location in Florida. Hell i‚Äôm thinking of covering this place on my YouTube channel. Everybody should visit at least once.

Daniel Seeman,5.0,"4.5 stars. It's really some of the best pizza I've ever had in the states. There are places with better dough (Pizza Time in St Augustine) and some with fresher toppings, but nothing has this taste. The coal firing really comes across, and gives it a profile that really can't be matched by a normal wood oven. Tap on a clip to paste it in the text box. They also have some of the best chicken wings I've ever tried.

I took off half a star (in the text at least) because the environment isn't anything special. The tables are generally too close together, the waiters are not very attentive, and the dressings are nothing fancy. I've had visits were I could smell the person at the table next to me.

Gloryanne Maldonado,1.0,"FORGOT TO ADD THIS REVIEW WHEN I VISIT LAST TIME ON 4/29/2017. Really disappointed! My husband and I went tonight 4/28/17 to this pizzeria since it's near our house. I was really craving gourmet pizza since I'm pregnant. It was a busy Saturday I get it! I was a server once but man we got stuck on a little two top in the corner witch is understandable since it was crowded our waitress NIKKI T seemed like she had a handful of a section. We continued to asked her about the menu and ordered a Margarita Pizza a small for 2 no big deal. When the pizza was delivered to our table it was by the runner not even our waitress no sign of her after they delivered our food. In the  process of eating we had a huge 6 top that walked in and put in our corner, no space whatsoever we're cramped ( at this point I was annoyed and not to mention uncomfortable due to my belly and space) I though she was going to ask us how our food was or if we needed any refills but instead treated her 6 top to beverages and gave them all the attention ( completely forgot about us) after a couple of minutes of delivering beverages to her 6 top she went over our cramped corner and asked if everything was fine (clearly it wasn't) she removed the empty pizza platter and I asked her for the check and nothing. I waited a couple more minutes and nothing I had to get up from our crowded corner to go to the cashier to request my check at this point she noticed that I was in the cashier and said ""I'm sorry"" that is not the way to treat a paying customer shame! Truly if her service was a lot better and acknowledge me and my husband genuinely I would have tip her more this night. End of story pizza wasn't that WOW FACTOR that I was looking for and not to mention the SERVICE of our waitress NIKKI T was NOT ACCEPTABLE. Pizza was BURNT and PRICE WISE too high for an ordinary pizza.",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 420 E Altamonte Dr ALTAMONTE SPRINGS FL 32701-4659 (407) 260-2625

Ruby Guerra,2.0,"Right after church we were looking for a different place to have lunch. Nothing fancy, just my husband, my 6 yr old grandson and I. My grandson wanted Wings, so we stepped at Anthony's and ordered a cheese large pizza, 2 ice teas, large order of wings & an individual small pizza fir my grandson.  The wings were very tasty and well seasoned; the teas were watered down considerably;  the cheese pizza was way too thin and we expected ""cheese,"" but there was more sauce than cheese; and lastly the small cheese pizza was just as thin and hardly any cheese with lots of sauce....plus it had large burnt bubbles, which my grandson did not want to eat from it...
Well, I figured, someone in the kitchen had a bad day, so maybe next time it will be better.  Then, came the check..... $5.98 for 2 watered down teas, $20.99 for the large wings (which, as I said were good, but not for that price!!),the ""cheese""less pizzas: the large was over $16.99 and the individual burnt one was $8.99. With tax etc the check came at a wopping $56.64!!

I did give the waitress $6.36 tip, to round up the total to $63.00, Angelina worked courteously and was attentive.

Now, I don't plan on returning any time soon.  The prices need to be commensurate with the product one purchases.  I do not find this to be true at Anthony's of Altamonte Springs.  Sorry!",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 420 E Altamonte Dr ALTAMONTE SPRINGS FL 32701-4659 (407) 260-2625

I ordered a simple large pepperoni pizza for myself and a family member for pickup, I went inside to get my pizza and to pay for it, when the bill was due, the pizza total after tax and all was 21 dollars and change.
I understand that we all need to make a living and what not, but for dough, tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni, that is 20 bucks?
If it was to die for then sure, but I've had plenty of 5 or 10 dollar pizzas that were 3 times better than that, not impressed or happy with that 20 dollar pizza",a year ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 420 E Altamonte Dr ALTAMONTE SPRINGS FL 32701-4659 (407) 260-2625

William Scheuer,1.0,"The prices for the small 12"" pizzas are too high for the item delivered.  We ordered a small 12"" pizza with mushrooms and arugula and ended up being charged for the Arugula Specialty Pizza with mushrooms as an extra topping after being told that arugula could be added as a topping.  $22 for a small pizza, was there really $4 worth of arugula?

In addition to this the draft beer came out with some sort of floating slime in it.  After alerting the bar staff another beer was brought, only to have it ALSO have the mystery slime in it.  We were told that it was due to ""just having changed the taps"".  Fine, but... no manager came to speak with us about it, and we were charged for the beer?!

Overpriced in general and the staff definitely didn't show any real interest in making things right.

But, unfortunately they must have had a really off night.  Our party of five was crammed in an awkward area of the restaurant for starters.  Then after ordering, we waited forever for our drinks.  She never did bring the lemon for our waters.  Two tables that arrived after us were served appetizers and pizza and we continued to wait.
We did finally get served the meatball appetizer, but had no plates or utensils. Oh, and we never did receive our salad.  Also, we had to keep flagging our server down for refills too.  The manager, who was busy visiting tables and offering samples seemed to purposefully ignore us (probably because of the awkward area we were sitting in.)

The manager never came to us. The drinks are a total ripoff- everything is bottled, including the iced tea, meaning no refills.

Mrs. Chiefy McWifey,4.0,First time ever here. We were told to mention that to the waitress for a complimentary appetizer. We did and she couldn't have cared less. When I voiced my opinion loud enough for the few patrons that were here @ 4pm on a Saturday afternoon to hear I guess that did the trick. After ordering our pizza from the VERY limited menu the manager strolls over and starts talking about his egg plant dish and asked if we would like to try it. I'm glad we did!! It was amazing! But what came next was even MORE so!! The pizza was to DIE for!!! Crispy on the bottom with what had to be the freshest vegetables I've ever had on a pizza. Not sure we ever got our comp'd app because the bill came to $40 for 2 beers (which were horrible) and a large pizza.

Debra Davids,2.0,"I wish that I could gave Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza in Altamonte Springs a better review than 2 stars, but my recent experience there (and we have enjoyed their pizza many times in the past) was far from 5-star.
More than 6 months ago we contacted Anthony's to book a reservation for 40 people for a major family party. In January we personally visited the restaurant to confirm with the manager on duty the date, time and number of people we were expecting. We even saw the memo that was posted scheduling the date and time for our party. And last week we called in our order, in advance, and reconfirmed the date and time and number of guests. So when we arrived last Friday to find that the staff were totally unprepared for our party, we were very disappointed. We were told that we were not expected to arrive until 1 hour later in spite of the fact that every conversation we had with Anthony's confirmed the time for dinner. So we and our 40 guests stood at the bar (there was no place to sit) for more than 1 hour while diners finished eating so that the tables could be set for our party. Even the 4 elderly people (2 handicapped, one on a walker and one with a cane) had to stand with the rest of us. What was perhaps most disappointing, if the fact that Anthony's management totally dropped the ball on our arrangements wasn't enough, was the apparent lack of  genuine concern for our predicament. No manager stepped up and took responsibility for the mismanaged reservation. No one appeared to make our 40 guests an urgency. I would of thought that some ""courtesy"" might have been extended to us and our guests for the inconvenience which was the fault of Anthony's and not ours, but none was forthcoming.  Once we were finally seated there wasn't even any evidence that anyone was interested in expediting service for our party. We were told that the kitchen was expecting us an hour later and that was that.
As for the food-  the pizzas, salads, wings and desserts- all was as expected. And I was sure to generously tip the servers on the food and drinks since the problems we encountered were not their fault). But I would discourage anyone from planning on entertaining a large party at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza in Altamonte Springs regardless of how many visits and conversations there were in making the arrangements.
Will we eat again at Anthony's? Probably. But I will think twice if our dinner party is any larger than 4 people.",3 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 420 E Altamonte Dr ALTAMONTE SPRINGS FL 32701-4659 (407) 260-2625

Lisa P,2.0,"Mixed feelings about this place.  One time it's great, next time, not so much.  First visit, the Manager is all friendly and offering complimentary wings, which were delicious.  He's like, oh, let me know when you bring your family back.  Second visit, we brought our brother and sister in law, raving about the place.  Tried to flag down the manager several times to say hi, but he ignored us.  My husband drives right by there on his way home from work, so we've gotten to go orders several times.  He has refused to eat the food there anymore.  Two to-go orders ago, our large order of wings, which costs $21, was completely smothered with like a pound of the caramelized onions thus making the wings inedible because they were covered in grease.  The Family sized salad is always good, but the lettuce was not drained and completely wet with water, which dilutes the delicious salad dressing!  Tonight's order was for me only, because hubby says he won't eat the food anymore.  I told the gal taking the order I wanted all flats on my wings and she says no problem, but we were charged extra for that.  Well, I got mostly drums, which I don't care particularly like.  The wings used to be nice and meaty, but there was very little meat on all of my wings that I attempted to eat, they were very large, but boney, which is kind of odd.  Anthony's had better get their consistency game on or they're not going to be open in 6 months from losing customers.  When you get take out food and order things specifically, you get it home and you can't change it, so what are you going to do, stand in the restaurant and unpack it all to check it?  Not convenient.  We won't be coming back.

I challenge you to answer this review, because it appears you only reply to the good ones.  And/or find a way to get the to go orders right so when folks get their food home, they can actually eat it.  Ours went in the garbage tonight.

Oh, and they have a Philly Cheese Steak PIZZA.  But when I asked if we could get a Philly Cheese Steak Sub, the girl quickly said NO.  Seriously?  You're from New York and you won't serve a Sub when you have the ingredients?
