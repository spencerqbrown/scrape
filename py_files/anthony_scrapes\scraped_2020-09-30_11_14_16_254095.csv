Cody Obropta,5.0,"Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza is an awesome spot. They have a great modern look with both indoor and outdoor seating separated by a large sliding glass door. The bar and tables are clean and elegant and plenty of the beer on tap is brewed specifically for the company!
My friends and I really enjoyed the pizza. The classic plain pizza is high-quality. It features great sauce and a soft, chewy crust that has very good flavor. The white pizza is also deliciously cheesy and cooked to perfection. I would definitely eat here again.",5 months ago,Closed,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 10 Sterling Blvd ENGLEWOOD NJ 07631-4834 (201) 431-9404

Owner contacted me apologising for the mistake and offered me a comp. its v rare these days for owners to be in touch to do something like this and shows they really care

Original review:

really want to say I love the pizzas here the orders keep getting messed up. Can you spot whats missing?

....

No Feta and No Arugla....and the other half of the pizza had only some tom sauce...

It was presented so good, the crust was thin and crispy, and they had the perfect blend of ingredients. It looked and tasted so good I thought I‚Äôd get it again. I ordered to go, the same pie from the Englewood establishment last night. It was unfortunately neither good to look at or eat. It looked like the preparer took a spoon and plopped the ingredients on. I would get a mouthful of sauce then a mouthful of cheese. And that was the Margarita side. The white  was just as bad. Worst pizza I‚Äôve had.

Charlie Unagast,5.0,"The chicken wings are unlike any wings i have ever had,  i am obsessed with them.  The onion and bread with the wings are phenominal too.  The pizza is about as top rate as you're going to find.  The crust is the most obvious thing you'll notice,   the coal fire oven really cooks everything perfectly.  One of my fav Pizza spots.",2 years ago,Closed,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 10 Sterling Blvd ENGLEWOOD NJ 07631-4834 (201) 431-9404

Cherie Lambiase,1.0,I'm extremely disappointed and I will never order delivery from this place again. I ordered a 12 inch pie with the meatballs and ricotta cheese. It was so dry my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth.The meatballs were tiny and burnt.  I needed two glasses of water to wash it down. I also ordered the chicken wings with the grilled onions and focaccia bread. The wings were a little better but still dry as well. I needed those grilled onions to help the dry food. The focaccia bread was also like cardboard. It cost me $42.45 for these two items which I thought would be absolutely spectacular and delicious but it was just so overpriced and so not worth the money. Your so much better off ordering from your favorite small local pizza place.If I weren't sick and I didn't have pajamas on in the comfort of my home I would have got in my car and returned the food items myself. I forgot to mention that I also paid a food delivery business to deliver the food and paid for that service and tip on top. Total bill was $59.52. This was the worst $60.00 I ever spent on food.,3 years ago,Closed,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 10 Sterling Blvd ENGLEWOOD NJ 07631-4834 (201) 431-9404
