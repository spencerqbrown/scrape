I advised him I was picking up an order I placed over the phone. We both realized I placed the order at their other location which I had already paid for over the phone. Instead of sending me almost a half hour in the opposite direction he whipped up a batch and had it out in ten minutes!! He also gave me a discount for the wait even though it was my error!

John Dsurney,1.0,"We have eaten here many times and always had been pleased.  However, since it was a saturday night I looked to see if I could make a reservation.  Sure enough, they had a place to make a reservation using open table.  I made the reservation and received a confirmation.  When we arrived, there was not a table available.  I asked for the manager who informed me that they do not take reservations.  I suggested she look at their own website.  They offered to put our name on the waiting, so accommodating.  Do not plan on making a reservation or being treated with any degree of customer service.

As you can see the response from the owner describes their error as a ""misscommunication""  this implies that I share some blame in their failure to honor the reservation.  Now in addition to provide poor service they blame the customer.  That makes me really want to go there, I wonder what other problems I can bring upon myself.",7 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 1901 S Dale Mabry Hwy TAMPA FL 33629-5816 (813) 258-2625

Stevie Shumate,5.0,"The manager at the S. Tampa location, Jessica, is one of the most professional, genuine, and thoughtful people I have met.  She turned a bad experience from Grub Hub into an amazing one - because of her quick thinking and willingness to help, I will be a repeat customer of Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza!  I would highly recommend NOT ordering through Grub Hub.  The first pizza I received was delivered cold and the delivery itself was messy and awkward.  The pizza wasn't contained in any sort of hot box/bag and was basically tossed to me from the passenger side - the driver and his sidekick quickly drove off after saying they didn't need a signature.  You'd think the recommended 20% gratuity for Grub Hub would at LEAST involve the driver getting out of the vehicle and handing it to you after verifying the order is correct.  I called the store immediately to pass along this information so that they knew how a 3rd party was representing their company.  Chris answered the phone and was very kind - he immediately passed me along to Jessica.  As soon as I told her the story, she was very quick to offer not just a short term solution, but a true remedy to the issue.  She offered (basically insisted) that she drive a fresh pizza to me personally - that was not expected and I really appreciate her making that extra effort.  Overall, I'm still very unhappy with Grub Hub and do not plan on using them ever again.

Nathalia G,4.0,"Nice pizza, very delicious, I would really recommend it. However there was a bit of arugula in mine though I didn't ask for it, so that's why I didn't give them the 5 stars, but regardless of that it was a great pizza. I recommend more going to the restaurant instead of using uber eats, specially if you got a coupon from uber, because I tried to use it and after not being able to, I called them, they told me to place it in the app anyways and after that they would reimburse me the money for the free pizza (I bought two pizzas) and then they refused to honor what they told me.

So, go to the restaurant if you want their pizza and don't use uber coupons. I know it is not their  fault, otherwise I would've given them 1 star, I just want to advice someone that might be thinking about using that coupon.",9 months ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 1901 S Dale Mabry Hwy TAMPA FL 33629-5816 (813) 258-2625

Scott Wyler,5.0,"This was my first visit to any Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza locations, which is odd, being as I consider myself a bit of a pizza connoisseur. My initial impression of the restaurant was great. Clean, neat, well-staffed and inviting. Permeating with the scent of pizza; I couldn't wait to eat.

Service was prompt and very courteous. They have a bar with outdoor seating, which was tempting, but I chose to be seated at a table today. I ordered a cheese pizza, in an attempt to sample the unblemished goods in their most natural state.

My order came out quickly and correctly. The pizza is thin-crusted with ample cheese and a fresh splattering on tomato across the top - a nice touch, both to the eye and the palate. It was 'love at first bite'. Perfectly cooked, you get the coal-fired crunch to start. The sauce was completely on point! Fresh cheese and fresh ingredients gave it the sensational one-two punch that you've come not to expect from a lot of other pizza places these days. No shortcuts here. It was absolutely extraordinary and I (embarrassingly) found myself devouring the entire pie in less that 10 minutes! üò≥

While stuffing my face, I was greeted by the manager, Jessica, who couldn't have been more welcoming and friendly. We got to talking a bit and it only took me a few moments to recognize that this is a person who truly loves what she does and takes great pride in her store. There's a lot to be said for that and it's much of what drove this review.

Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza earned themselves a loyal customer today, based on my overall experience.

Update: It's been 2 years and I can honestly say I still think about this pizza. I came back today (Feb 16, 2020) and the pizza is still as wonderful and consistent as ever. Every single ingredient was FRESH. From the sausage to the onions to the sauce and more! I can honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best pizza I've ever had in my life. And if you look at my past reviews, one could consider me a tad bit of a ""foodie"". Anyways, I sat there and tried to find fault in this pizza and I found NONE.

Butch Sanders,5.0,"I have to admit - I LOVE PIZZA!!!  So I'm always looking for a great pie!

Moved back to my native Tampa from California about 4 years ago, and I was hunting for a pizza place (not the usual chain stuff, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc) that produced a REAL pizza.  Not the typical California, ""OH MY GOD!!! YOU WANT MEAT ON YOUR PIZZA???"" response from the specialty restaurants who... just... might be able to pull-off the perfect pie.

Anyway, long story short, Anthony's is - without question - the best pizza you will find in Tampa!!!  We order take-out from them at least once a week...  And I have become a BIG fan of their calzones (even more than their pies)!

I've noticed, through experience, that a lot of pizza vendors hawk their ""specialty"" calzones - only to find that they're simply 'dough-cakes' with little in between other than a few tomato slices, some onions (and a lot of air)...  Believe me, if you cut into an Anthony's calzone, you will find an entire pizza packed in there!!!  Hell, I order a large calzone and eat what I can (which is usually a significant amount of food), and then I cut the rest up and put it in the freezer for lunches.  I can get maybe 5 - 6 meals out of one large calzone!!!  Thank God no one else in the family likes calzone!!!

Ya gotta try it!  Pizza, calzone or whatever...  Anthony's will rock-your-pizza-lovin'- world!!!",2 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 1901 S Dale Mabry Hwy TAMPA FL 33629-5816 (813) 258-2625

Instead you pay 26.94.  We had a good waiter, but when I asked him about it,  he told me the manager could explain to me that it wasn't an upcharge for the split, even though the extra change is because they do 2 specialty toppings on one pizza.  I don't mind the charge nearly as much as no info about it on the menu, and the doublespeak nonsense.

Chip Weiner,4.0,"Pay attention to the Coal Fired part of the name. It's what makes this food so good! But be forewarned. Almost all dishes are baked and roasted in the oven leaving a black char on the food. It adds an abundance of flavor but may not be to some peoples liking.
I start with the Caprese salad ($5.49 for small) which consists of two thick slices of tomato, a thick slice of Grande mozzarella, and a generous portion of Basil, along with a stack of fresh roasted red and green peppers, Don't forget to add the olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the perfect bite. The tomato is fresh and perfectly ripened, the cheese is firm and creamy, and the shredded basil adds the right amount of herb to cap it all off.
Next it's the very large Original Coal Oven Roasted Chicken Wings ($6.49 for 5 wings). They are served stacked high and covered with caramelized onions and two crisp wedges of Focaccia Bread with rosemary seasoning. The wings are browned and crunchy on the outside with a little bit of char and moist and tender inside. Mixed with the onions and pepperd it's brilliant. This ain't no Buffalo wing!
If you're looking for a pizza and like garlic, you must try the Roasted Cauliflower Pizza- roasted cauliflower with olive oil & garlic, Romano & Mozzarella cheese, topped off with Bread Crumbs. The crust is crispy and slightly charred, the roasted cauliflower is firm and moist and the whole pie is a whirlwind of flavors and textures and absolutely delicious.
Sitting outside on cooler days is nice if you can tolerate the noise of the South Dale Mabry traffic whizzing by. Inside ambient music is a mix of disco, 70s rock, and Beatles. The lunchtime crowd was small and I was seated quickly. The service there after was decent if not a little slow. My server brought extra napkins and a drink refill after I had finished my meal. They offer a separate lunch menu but dinner items are still available. The bar is lined with flat screen TVs for watching sports and you can view inside or out. If you're looking for take out, Anthony's might be your place. They have a special door and parking spaces for carry out.",2 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 1901 S Dale Mabry Hwy TAMPA FL 33629-5816 (813) 258-2625

Steve Lacol,2.0,"Calzone was good; pizza was burnt.  The servers, and most of the kitchen staff, must know what a burnt crust smells/looks like? How could they serve it?
The wings are good, but you don't go to a pizza place for wings.
Beer selection was anemic, wine was good, if pricey.

Speaking of price, four people, one glass of wine, two cokes and a ""personal pizza"" and calzone and it was 60 bucks. Good luck, guys.
Suggest you stop by Tampa Gourmet Pizza company, get real dough, a real pie, served by kids in dreadlocks and tattoos, with a selection of 8-10 real beers.  Four can eat for less than $40.00, a good time had by all.",7 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 1901 S Dale Mabry Hwy TAMPA FL 33629-5816 (813) 258-2625

Paul Thrasher,4.0,"This is excellent artisan pizza.  Some may even call it old-style, not too different than what I've had in Italy.  Whatever you call it, call it good. The ingredients are fresh and the taste unique to the way they prepare them using a coal fire.  If you enjoy conveyer belt baked pizza this is not the restaurant for you.  But if you want good food in a friendly, informal setting, then this is a great place.  The pizza is thin and baked well done.  In fact, Anthoney's has that phrase as their motto, ""pizza well done"". There is also the ""warning"" in the restaurant that their pizza is ""well done"". So expect some char on the crust.  But there has to be to make sure the thin crust in the middle is cooked to completion.  Again, not a conveyer belt pizza.  Also, they have a great beer selection.  The couple next to me were unsure which beer to select and the hostess patiently asked about their likes and preferences and based on that brought them 3-4 samples to try to make sure they selected a beer that they would enjoy.  That doesn't happen everywhere.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.",5 years ago,Open,Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza 1901 S Dale Mabry Hwy TAMPA FL 33629-5816 (813) 258-2625
