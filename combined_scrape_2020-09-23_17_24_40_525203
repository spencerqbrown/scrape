Brenda Maloch,3.0,"Ordered through their app and it said it would be ready in 15 mins. I show up 20 mins later the girl at the window said 2 more minutes, and had me park beside the carry out marked parking spot. Waited 15 more minutes. FINALLY SHOWS UP! Mind you the app said it was ready when I was at the window for pickup. Must be clocked on when pizza actually is done and they are lying about the ACTUAL finished time! 😡 The pizza however was FANTASTIC!",3 weeks ago
Kare bear,3.0,The bread sticks were great. They had the right amount of cheese. I ordered a large chicken bell pepper extra cheese pizza . I got no extra cheese and the dough is soo weird. Like the middle is like so thin all the toppings just fall off.  And it just tasted off. Like the dough was expired or something. The extr,10 months ago

Misty Gotte,1.0,"Our two, three topping pizzas only had 1 and 2 toppings and our cheese sticks were old and not even sliced. Very disappointed. We have eaten here a lot in the past but this time was by far the worst we’ve experienced.",4 months ago
Rebecca Justus,4.0,"This place is hard to review. Their turnover is crazy so you never know what you're going to get. Sometimes it's hot, fast, and your order is always right. Then for a couple months they can't get a single order right and wait times are out of control. But it's Pizza Hut, so even when the store isn't great the pizza is great and they accept the deals and coupons from the app which not all of them do so we'll keep going back.",9 months ago
Rhonda Prine,5.0,Fast great pastA,a week ago
Bill Odwyer,4.0,"The hand tossed pizza was very good.  The salad bar was well stocked and clean, everything was very fresh.  Nice friendly staff.  I would love to go back to this store in Ash Flats.  The only problem was the bath room.  No soap to wash your hands, so you know the employees can't wash theirs.  I had a handicapped person with me and he could not get at the toilet paper, it was so low, the toilet paper dispenser.",10 months ago

When the staff do talk to you they are friendly through.",a year ago

Lynn Mitchell,1.0,"Waitresses are very insulting to customers then they deliver food to everyone else including the buffet and over an hour later they deliver the pizza that was ordered before everyone else ordered.  Then when customer orders a Dr. Pepper and the waitress decides that the customer needs a Diet Dr. Pepper and tells them that they can only bring them a Diet Dr. Pepper but brings their friend a regular Dr. Pepper.   
Guess these waitresses don't understand that they depend on TIPS to help supplement their income and insulting customers and letting their pizza sit on the counter for over 20 minutes isn't part of receiving a tip.",9 months ago

Yeet yeet Dawg 11,1.0,"We have been very disappointed the past 3 times we have ate at the ash flat store. John, the waiter, has always been amazing to us and always got our order correct. We haven’t got a correct order since the last time we saw him. We always tip John very well, $10-15, but do not get the same service when he isn’t there. I still tip but do not consider it a good investment due to the lack of good service. We will be trying the store in Batesville to see if the longer drive will be worth the service there. Definitely two thumbs down 👎 👎",a year ago

Doug Milner,5.0,"Good pizza & good pizza buffet. My only complaint  for the buffet is that sufficient  pizzas  should be made prior to opening the door at 11 am . In addition,  upon sending pizza out to the buffet, more pizza should be made to get in the oven. Once the pizza is sent out, there is a mad dash to get some & then a huge lag time with none until the next pizzas  are ready to come out!!!  Lick it in gear!!!!!!",3 years ago

Patricia Torres,1.0,"I understand that this pandemic is probably affecting all the pizza lovers in Ames but I’m pretty sure that not many people want to order pizza at 10 in the night. Anyways, me being one of those people, I ordered a large pizza that was supposed to be delivered at 11:55 (an hour and a half later then when ordered). It was a little after the initial delivery time and still no pizza. I called and they told me that the pizza was going to leave the store in about 10 minutes. I received it cold. For the price I paid, it was definitely not worth it.",3 months ago
Jim Crabb,2.0,"Update, not sure what Pizza hut has done to their pizza, but it no longer agrees with me, to the point I couldnt finish the last two slices. At a loss as to what to point too. To bad, overall I like Pizza Hut. 
I went to the store to order a Pepperoni Lovers pizza, which was a little shy of all the pepperoni it could have had. Also some of the slices tasted bland, could have used more sauce. Kind of pricey for what I got. The pizza was done in about 12 mins. Front desk help not that friendly but helpful. Will choose local choices next time...",a year ago
Jessica Wood,1.0,I ordered online and they claimed that someone called in and cancelled my order. When I called to find out where my delivery was they were very rude and unapologetic for their mistake. I’ve worked at pizza places before and the way they handled this situation was completely unprofessional. I will never be ordering from them again. All they had to do was apologize and offer to fix the mistake instead they were rude and quick to get of the phone.,2 months ago

Geizha Vargas,1.0,"Unfortunately a Pizza Hut that I usually sort of tidy up with my break alone 15 minutes called to order, the flame is silent twice and I even asked if they listened to me or told me I'm ordering and I drop the call, I can t return because I get to work when I get out of work I call back And the boy hangs me in  phone again and tells me that you are going to be to order or not, I tell you if and he tells me he hung up on me and I tell you that there was not much sign and talking about my very disrespectful me you tell me you're gonna order me or not, I told you you re disrespectful and I'm not going to order now, that clerk is disrespectful and by people like the one who gets lost customers",7 months ago

Mechelle Howieson,2.0,"We ordered to a hotel late night after a long day of traveling. Pizzas and breadsticks seem undercooked. Sauces were refrigerator cold.

Destini Scrivener,2.0,"The food is just... okay. As someone who really likes Pizza Hut it's kind of disappointing how mediocre the food is. The pizza crust is always very thick, toppings are sparse and the cheese lacks much flavor. However, the wings are pretty good. I wish there was another location in Ames because I really like Pizza Hut.",a year ago
Shawna Parsons,1.0,"Little Caesars is better and cheaper too. 2 large pep and bread sticks $16.00. 1 large is $14.00 with you guys. Sorry pizza hut, little Caesars here I come more food less money. The pizza is great too.",2 years ago

Kerry Orr,1.0,"I would give no stars if I could. Placed order for delivery, paid 2.99 for that fee on top of order and tip. Order was 30 minutes late and ice cold, driver called and said I can't find your apartment, if he would of read the ticket he would of known it was going to a business not apartment. When I called store was told I could wait another hour for them to send again or I could come get it. No I paid you 2.99 for delivery and now you want me to come get it! Called corporate in morning and they told me I can only recoup for the cost of food and I can pay again to have it deliver. So I have to pay for their mistake. I paid for it once already, now I have to pay for it again. Thanks💩",a year ago

Devon Henriksen,2.0,"Ordered some stuffed crust from here, the stuffed crust part was the only good thing about the pizza, there was little to no sauce at all, I could literally see through my pizza crust because there was barely any cheese and sauce, I didn't even ask for thin crust. Not sure what it is but it's always Pizza Hut that does this all wrong.",2 years ago
Nyssa cat,2.0,"Ordered pizza for delivery and got a confirmation email and waited for the timer on their website to run out. After it ran out and we didnt have our pizza, we called. They told us they didnt have an order under our name and they told us it was because our address was invalid. Ok, why didnt they call us and let us know then? They told us they could start a new order out for delivery and it would take a little over an hour. Cool. The driver couldnt find our apartment and rather than calling, drove back to pizza hut and THEN called us. So we had to wait even more time and the driver still couldnt find our apartment so we had to stand outside and wave them down. Its amazing how incompetent they were. Whole process took about 3 hours.",a year ago
Barry Williams,1.0,I try not to complain but even though the pizza taste great even after messing up my crust. My experience wasn't great the ceiling vents are covered in dust from how long I have no idea makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like. Last of all how hard is it to say hi when you walk in the door. Must of been management. If there was another pizza hut or a godfathers I would go there.

With only four simple words, I managed to unravel hidden talent and creativity locked away in a pizzeria kitchen. As you can examine from the artifact I've attached the intricate bold sharpie strokes that passionately express our majestic hero. Truly a masterpiece. This piece of work is now framed and hanging in my living room. God bless this unknown artist, the delivery guy, and 620 Lincoln Way's Pizza Hut.

Ron West,5.0,"Even though they botched my order last time, pretty hard. They helped me gain a better footing on my most recent purchase. What I really enjoy so far from the Pizza Hut in my town, are the drivers. I typically like to give atleast a 12-18% tip but this time I misread the total and only gave my drive a $2 tip, but being a regular who orders once a week because im too lazy, he simply said ""eh don't worry about it, we do business with you enough"" , laughed and went on his way.
