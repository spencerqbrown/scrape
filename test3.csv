I show up 20 mins later the girl at the window said 2 more minutes, and had me park beside the carry out marked parking spot. Waited 15 more minutes. FINALLY SHOWS UP! Mind you the app said it was ready when I was at the window for pickup.

Rebecca Justus,4.0,"This place is hard to review. Their turnover is crazy so you never know what you're going to get. Sometimes it's hot, fast, and your order is always right. Then for a couple months they can't get a single order right and wait times are out of control. But it's Pizza Hut, so even when the store isn't great the pizza is great and they accept the deals and coupons from the app which not all of them do so we'll keep going back.",9 months ago,1000804749.0

Guess these waitresses don't understand that they depend on TIPS to help supplement their income and insulting customers and letting their pizza sit on the counter for over 20 minutes isn't part of receiving a tip.",9 months ago,1000804749.0

We haven’t got a correct order since the last time we saw him. We always tip John very well, $10-15, but do not get the same service when he isn’t there. I still tip but do not consider it a good investment due to the lack of good service. We will be trying the store in Batesville to see if the longer drive will be worth the service there.

The wings were good but the pizza was just plain bad. 2 medium pizzas had a total of 6 pepperoni, combined, and almost no cheese. They were basically 2 medium loves of bread. No flavor and ice cold.

Joel Goss,1.0,"So, after not being able to place an order for over an hour and half of calling (due to the line being constantly and unendingly busy) I placed my order online. It was delivered after my delivery guy lost and then found my childrens large half pepperoni half cheese pizza in his car, I opened it to find it wasn't half cheese half pepperoni.  A lot of the toppings had slid off the pizza and onto the side of the box, making it half pepperoni half no toppings.  If this was my first poor experience from this location I would chalk it up to win some lose some reality, however this type of outcome when ordering food from this location is regular.  It bums me out, there is only really one pizza location in the area and this is it.  Order @ your own risk, we do, and now I will be having to ask every driver to open the pizza box and show me what I am paying for before taking it into my home.  Common sense dictates I should have done that before signing the receipt, but lesson learned.",3 years ago,1000804753.0

Food came out reasonably quickly then we didnt see our server for another 10 minutes.  Brought refills and then disappeared. We ended up asking another server for a box and then that same server for our bill because we never saw our server again.  I left before the bill was brought so I cant say how that went.

Kathy Harms,1.0,"It was horrible... the worst Pizza Hut that I have ever been to. The waitress was absolutely the worst. I don't know who trained her but they should fired right along with her. She had no idea. We ordered pizzas and one order of spaghetti. We finally got are pizzas after waiting way to long. We were half way done with are pizzas when she finally brought the spaghetti out she said it just came out ,we'll it couldn't of it was ice cold. Then we asked her for a box for the pizza and spaghetti she gave us 2 Pizza BOXES . REALLY. Then we couldn't get her to come back to are table finally got the other waitress attention and asked her to tell our waitress we wanted to see her.we waited another 20 minutes,so my husband went up to see if he could get something to put the spaghetti in. Couldn't get anyone to help him, so he went to the take out counter to get something they didn't really want to help him either but they did. I don't know what they were doing but they needed to get there ass out of the kitchen and take care of the customers. It was just horrible service and food. I will never recommend that place to anyone.",3 years ago,1000804753.0
Dave G,5.0,"We Ordered from this Pizza Hut all year for my son and other students that attends school in Howe, In. We ordered dozens of pizzas there almost every week.  Naturally,  they have made a couple human errors. But, they gave Always made good with their end of the bargain. So, over the course of the whole year the pizzas were made Right 99% of the time. If not they made it right with our family and students.  The managers and staff are very friendly and helpful.  Delivery drivers polite and on time as well. Not bad for delivering hundreds of pizzas this year to the school.  

I hope this was helpful!

We were going to have a salad, but after looking at the disgusting appearance of the salad bar, we changed our minds.  We told the waitress we couldn't chew the crust.

We've been lucky enough have him as our server several times and he's ALWAYS made our experience 100x better. He was thoughtful enough to sanitize the pen before handing it over for us to sign. Pizza huts food was pretty good, we got plenty of marinara sauce which is something I feel is always over looked.

Adrian Cooper,5.0,"This pizza hut stands out in my mind as the one with the kindest and most thorough customer service i've experienced with the franchise. 

My roommate and I went for dinner on Black Friday - I worked that morning, and we decided to try this place before we went shopping. 

We had an amazing time. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I ordered a Sprite with a cherry shot, which was nice and sweet, but the Sprite had ran out of syrup. When I asked for another, she immediately went to check, fixed the syrup herself, and waited for me to try my replacement to see if I liked it or wanted something else.

We also tried the new garlic knot crust, which our waitress admitted was the first one ordered here. The garlic knots had to be made by hand first and then placed on the crust, and the staff asked for our feedback on where they were placed and how it tasted. It was very good! We do plan to go back and get this again.

We also got the cinnabon rolls and bread sticks, so we knew we would need boxes for everything. Our waitress helped us box everything, chatted with us while she did, and rang us up shortly after, even when more customers started coming in and she had to wait on them.

P. A.,1.0,"Atrocious service.  When I walked in, I was the only customer.  Although there were at least 4 people standing there talking, no one made an effort to wait on me.  Another woman came from the back and did so.  She was very nice, but seemed unsure of herself.  Once my order was placed, she told me she'd call my name when it was ready.  So, I took a seat at the entrance and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Nearly 30 minutes later I went to the counter to see where my food was.  There was no one in sight.  Even when I called out, no one appeared.  After a few minutes, a young man with a jacket on walked in.  He was, clearly, a delivery driver.  I asked him about my order.  He stepped over to the holding oven, stared at it and did nothing else.  When the woman who waited on me returned, he walked away mumbling she could help.  I needed to show my receipt to prove I had an order.  When she walked back to the kitchen area, she came out and stated my order had just come out.  Please!  This place had only one other order after mine!  With such abysmal service, I've no idea how they stay in business.  Someone MUST actively and properly manage the place.  To top it all off, the bone-outs weren't completely sauced.  It is their job to get it right.  Nice enough people, but terrible service!",a year ago,1000804756.0

Oven was broken apparantly which is why it was so busy, and you should've seen how many people were standing in the lobby. Total cluster mess. The poor guy at the front I felt bad for him but this place needs some serious help. Everytime I've ordered theres been a problem. Whether it's late and cold, or it's not what I ordered, theres always something.  I think they need some help here. I'd advise getting pizza elsewhere, at least until things change for the better.

Thankfully, I was given an opportunity elsewhere. However, once I gave my two weeks notice and my new job called for a reference, I was sabotaged by my manager because she was angry I was leaving. Thank God that I had other excellent references. The ironic part is, months later the corporation was calling me asking me to come back. I said no Thank you. I have since learned that this Pizza Hut is under a new manager, and I wish him well.

There are some wonderful people that work at this establishment. They are what kept me going at the low points of my employment experience. 

The food is still on par with any other Pizza Hut you may go too. 

Also, please beware that if you or someone you know Applies to be a delivery driver for PH, the company does not tell them that there is a difference between personal auto insurance and commercial exposure when they are delivering pizzas. In other words, while PH mandates that all delivery drivers have their own auto insurance they do not tell delivery drivers that they will not be covered by their own insurance if they get into an accident while on duty, because when you are using your own auto for business purposes, then your personal auto insurance is not appropriate in the hours you are delivering their food.

There were micro size pieces and gargantuan pieces that had to be cut again personally. I'll still go because I live in colchester and they're cheap and open but don't expect a home run at this one. I mean they could hit one for you but they haven't for me yet. Also... One more thing..

Ordered a buffalo chicken pizza with a pull apart crust. Got a buffalo chicken stuffed crust and it tasted more sweet than spicy, but was red. Tasted awful. Got up to leave and we stood at the register for another 10 minutes while three employees ignored us after looking DIRECTLY at us. Instead of saying that they would be right with us they simply continued on with their tasks. Clearly we didnt eat but he didnt ask us why we didnt eat or if we wanted a box or anything.

Jason Martin,1.0,"Below was a previous post but today my opinion changed.  We ordered pizza for take you child to work day and not only did they not fill the order....they told us we couldn't order again.  Things get messed up, I understand. But for a general manager to be the jerk he was and refuse to even make pizzas if we reorder is ridiculous. My opinion has completely changed. I don't know if there was a change of management but there should be after today. 

We have always had good service year. If they say that your order is going to be ready at a specific time you will never need to wait. They are always very good about asking if you need any type of plates or silverware. At one point we had bought a bunch of pizza for a birthday party at a local hotel and that one question was a life saver",a year ago,1000804783.0

If I was blindfolded, I would have had no idea it was pizza hut pizza, even with the stuffed crust. Not sure if it was because I purchased it with the 50% off deal, or if it was just a bad few pizzas... BUT the top was burnt, the crust was thin AND doughy, and the sauce tasted nothing like their signature sauce. It was my 1st time ordering from this location because we're new to the area, and unfortunately it will be my last. 16 bucks (glad it wasn't $32 with the menu price) down the drain, my family and I had ""a"" slice a piece and tossed the rest of that box, and the other burnt untouched box.

Tonight I come in, place my order and have a seat.  That same older guy comes out with a pizza.  Since they didn't take names they have no clue what pie goes where.  He said the type of pizza it was, an older lady who was in before me said that's hers and left.  She then comes in a min later with the box open saying it's not hers.  They closed it and told me it's mine, screw that.  I'd like a pizza that wasn't taken outside to a car, opened and brought back in.

Matt Richards,2.0,"This is by far the slowest and worst pizza in the area. It always takes at least an hour for a pizza to be delivered when every other pizza in the area takes around 30 minutes and deliver a much higher quality pizza.

Choosing to pickup for the order does not solve this problem as I have gone to pickup the order at the expected time - only to sit in the lobby for around 20 minutes to still wait for my order with many other angry customers, some of which decided that the wait was way too long and asked for their money back.

Stay away from this establishment for sure and order from one of the faster, better pizza places in the area.",7 years ago,1000804783.0
pc8224,1.0,"OK, can anybody tell me what the hell is going on with Pizza Hut?  For years I had great pizzas and food from Pizza Hut. However, the last two times I have had their food, it has been absolutely horrendous.  And this took place in two different states in 2 totally different regions of the country, so it has to be more than coincidence. I had boneless buffalo wings that were soaked in their own sauce and completely soggy, I had a pan pizza that was burnt, and a replacement pizza that reaked of Parmesan even though I didn't order any.  Stay away from this Pizza Hut.... and maybe all of them are bad anymore, I just don't know. 

But after having two bad experiences in a row, I can only come to one conclusion. Is Pizza Hut becoming the new Domino's,  replacing them as the bastion of bad food & pizza ?

Nick Hagman,4.0,"Not sure why this is called Pizza Hut. 

Delivery was fast, customer service nice, but just like every review here, there is something off with the pizza. Don't get me wrong, it actually tastes good! But it doesn't taste Pizza Hut good. The personal pan pizza was very thin, cheese wasn't stringy, looks overcooked, the toppings look like they were just thrown on as an afterthought...

And yet I give 4 stars. Because it tastes good. I'm confused, because it doesn't look like the pizza would taste good, and yet it does! It just comes to show that looks isn't everything. For instance, the Pizza Hut in Westminster LOOKS like it would taste good, but I've never had worse pizza in my life.

To sum up: is the food good? Yes. Is it Pizza Hut good? No. Would I still recommend it? Yes. Have I had worse pizza before? Yes.

I called and placed an order but my food never arrived.

Kelly's Joyous Cooking,5.0,"Ok, so it's pizza hut lol. Pretty standard fair, but I happen to LOVE the cheese bread sticks with every fiber of my being lol. My guilty pleasure, so to speak. Fluffy, cheesy, carb-laden goodness 😁 Today I placed an online order and came to the restaurant at the designated time to pick up my order. It was clean and modern and the staff was super friendly. They forgot to make my order, and instead of blaming and denying the manager (Niles) did something you rarely see: apologize and acknowledge. I wish more places realized that's the real first step in making things up to the customer. Sincere and honest. And that's exactly what he did. He also offered me some credit for future use to make up for my time. Not only will I continue to come back to this location (unlike the Windsor Domino's, which is the polar opposite to this in terms of customer service, and a place I will NEVER return to) but I will also recommend. Thank you for rectifying a mistake in the best way possible. You are going a great job!!! And the breadsticks with cheese was yummy as always ❤️",a year ago,1000804789.0

It seems that they will never get the sauce or crust right unless you get a plain cheese pizza and even then you're lucky if the cheese covers the whole thing.

I called and talked to the manager, who was very apologetic, and offered us a credit towards our next pizzas or remake them.  We decided to have them remade.  I asked the manager to make sure they were cooked thoroughly,  not burned, cooked correctly he said. I agreed. 

They arrived about 35 minutes later and guess what, yep, raw dough again!!!

I will never order from them again!",2 years ago,1000804789.0
Chadd Bryant,1.0,"Disgusting.  Filthy.  Unclean.  I seriously leave Pizza Hut angry every time.  Sure, the kids like it but it's so filthy it makes me want to vomit.  Every time I go in, I notice that the urinal has old, dried, yellow urine flaking off of the whole inside of the bowl.  It must take years to get like that, yet no one ever bothers to clean it.  If the bathrooms are any indication of the cleanliness of the kitchen, YUCK!   The booths are always sticky.  The window sills are so dusty I have to keep my kids from writing their names in the dust.  Normally, we eat half of our meal without silverware or drinks and finally someone comes over to ask if we need anything.  Get a new manager.",9 years ago,1000804789.0

Having not ate at a physical PH for 10+ years, we had no idea. They do not make medium pizzas anymore on a deal. You have to order these square pizzas. And they are horrible. Hardly any cheese, no sauce. Since we had to order 3 of them for $20, I assumed they could just box one of them and bring us the other two. This lady brings us a giant box and puts it on the table next to us. I asked if that w as our food and she said yes. Umm then why are you putting on another table? Why aren’t you bringing us plates? We waited a good 5 minutes, our waitress never came over so we ate of napkins, and pizza out of a box. We might as well just ate at home. Service sucked. Pizza sucked. Still paid full price. I will never go back here and hope you think twice before you do also. There’s a reason that parking lot was empty on a Saturday night at 6pm..",2 years ago,1000804789.0

I had to run to the kitchen and get a cookie sheet just to put the boxes of wings on so they didn't drip.  I guess the girl didn't know not to set heavy things on it??  Whatever - it's WingStreet!  Can't complain too much!

Edit: We don't go here anymore because of the flies.  I don't know how I will ""test"" to see if they've fixed their fly problem and start eating here again, but I guess that's their problem.  Dominoes and Brick Oven Pizza are just fine alternatives.",8 years ago,1000804789.0
