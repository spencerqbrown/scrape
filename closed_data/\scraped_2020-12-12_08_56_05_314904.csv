Gregory Perko,3.0,"This place is close to where I work, so I‚Äôve come here multiple times due to proximity. The food is usually great for Papa Gino‚Äôs quality.

Neil Singer,4.0,"They always make tasty pizza here, but the time it takes to get your order ready can vary greatly.  I was told to expect a 15 minute wait, but the actual wait was 50 minutes for today's order.  On the positive side, it was delicious.",2 years ago,Closed,1000856174
Matt Valuk,4.0,One of the best Papa Gino's in the area. The pizza is consistently good and not greasy.  The service is consistently great.  My son loves the duck claw game.,2 years ago,Closed,1000856174
peace searcher,3.0,Pizza sauce tasted fair. Didn't think the integrity of the slice stood up.  Needed to put a lot of oregano and parmesan cheese on it.  I like going into joints just to get a couple of slices. I mean it was a quick lunch I'll let this pass.,2 years ago,Closed,1000856174
Patricia Desjardins,1.0,"Ordered the Patriots special.
Chicken came out barely warm. Pizza was stiff like cardboard and ever so slightly warm. Even after adding Parmesan cheese and oregano there was little flavor.

ROBERT MONTALTO,1.0,Place is terrible. Brought food to the wrong address then asked if I could come pick it up at the store. Pizza was cold and two hours late.

April O'Patchen,1.0,Literally the worst pizza I've ever tasted. We moved here from florida and wanted to try a northern chain or whatever this papa gino's is... the sauce tastes like they squeezed the juice from a tomato and then watered it down and threw it on the pizza. Even the cheese tastes watered down. 0 flavor and the crust sucks.,3 years ago,Closed,1000856174
Sara Lamb,1.0,"They lost my order, after the pizza was 20 minutes late I called. They said they couldn't find it.  The manager offered nothing but ""rushing"" the order which would be ANOTHER hour.  I cancelled my order, just moved into the area and they lost a pizza eating family's business!  NO costumer service!",4 years ago,Closed,1000856174
A Stygles,4.0,"Their pizza used to be a bit so-so, but the strong oregano flavors help it. The crust is a little thick, however, and is the weakest point. The plain wings were surprisingly good.",4 years ago,Closed,1000856174
