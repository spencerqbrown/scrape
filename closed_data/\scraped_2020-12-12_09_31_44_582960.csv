Derek McDermott,5.0,"Have some good sandwiches,  got my couple of favorites when i go in there. Customer service is usually good,  and never too packed in there, at least not the times i have been. I dont go here too often, but probably go here again soon. Def not too bad.",2 years ago,Closed,1000879646
Tracy Ventresca,3.0,Went to the one by the west side Shaw's. Service pretty much sucked. They took a half hour to make two subs and they were cold subs. It tasted good but it was pretty much thrown together bc we had waited so long. I do not blame the company bc they do have awesome subs but they really need new employees,3 years ago,Closed,1000879646
