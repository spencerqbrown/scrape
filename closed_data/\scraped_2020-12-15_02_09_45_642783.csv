Jamie Mitchell,1.0,This location sucks.  It's been over 75 minutes for delivery  and took over 10 minutes to get anybody on the phone  to even locate my order and that person couldn't tell any info.  Not the first time either.   Thought I'd try again after a year  but the service is just as crappy.  I will contact my credit card to fight the charge.,4 years ago,Closed,2000015615
