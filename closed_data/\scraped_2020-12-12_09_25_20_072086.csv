Fernando Medeiros,2.0,"First, I love Papa Gino‚Äôs pizza and their food. However, I gave this place 2 stars (and not 1 star) because they messed up my order and I had to wait for them to fix it and I didn‚Äôt get anything for waiting. Apparently they don‚Äôt value my time and that‚Äôs extremely poor customer service.",2 years ago,Closed,1000841828

Robert Bresten,2.0,"This place is run down and drab looking, the pizza is always soggy and one wonders why you'd even eat it.
