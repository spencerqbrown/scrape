Brittny Davis,2.0,Normally it's pretty good. Service is however very slow. Last night I ordered a pizza online at10pm. A little after 11 my pizza still had not arrived. I called the location and was told that they were now closed and the driver was still out â€¦More,5 years ago,Closed,1000818178

Shaun Williams,1.0,Very bad service tables were filthy. Waited 10 minutes for somebody to finally greet me and when she did I was asked do you know what you want. I told her no because i hadnt looked at the menu. Decided to go somewhere else. They seem to be more focused on carry out and delivery. Heed the other reviews and avoid this location.,4 years ago,Closed,1000818178
