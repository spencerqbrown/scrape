Michael Ezell,5.0,"Genius idea for pizza , made fresh in front of you while you wait. Then go home to cook in your oven. Mine tasted truly awesome with more then expected topping.  I really like the cowboy.",4 years ago,Closed,2000588396
chad morrow,2.0,Workers are usually very friendly and the food is good. Giving it low ratings b/c of the prices. The prices are way too expensive for the basic ingredients and also having to cook it yourself. Drop the prices by a few dollars and this place would be in competition with the big chains..,3 years ago,Closed,2000588396
