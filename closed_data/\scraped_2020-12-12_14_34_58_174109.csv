Ahmed,5.0,"I typically try to avoid corporate / chain restaurants as much as possible, but I can't seem to do that with D'Angelos. Everything there tastes fresh, good portions, bread is excellent, and it's all fairly priced. I've never been disappointed eating there; I always leave happy.",2 years ago,Closed,1000868001

Greg DeCristofaro,3.0,Very sloppy sandwich even though they really skimped on the veggies. The roll (multi grain) was tough and chewy. The sandwich was kind of small for the price. The place was clean and the staff was friendly enough.,3 years ago,Closed,1000868001
