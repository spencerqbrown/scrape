Zig Ray,1.0,Only reason I gave one star is because I had to in order to give a review. Food was disgusting and will be giving it to the seagulls in the morning! Food was cold and the onion rings and curly fries were so limp and soggy they must have been straight from the freezer then heated up in microwave!,4 years ago,Closed,2000634479
