Diane Harkison,5.0,This evening we had a great experience at Pizza Hut. The server greeted us with a smile & seated us right away. The service was excellent. She says new management reopened the restaurant about 1 month ago. The food was fresh and delicious. The restaurant was shiny & clean. We will definitely be back soon.,a year ago,Closed,1000819696
