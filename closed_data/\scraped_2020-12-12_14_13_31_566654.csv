Sasha Homes,5.0,This pizza was amazing. I highly recommend. I liked how you could put any toppings you want and any amount. I also liked how you could choose the size of the pizza and the crust. The desserts were also very good.,2 years ago,Closed,1000806739
Shannon Long,1.0,"Took two hours to deliver a medium pizza and breadsticks. The sauce made a whole in my breadsticks and the pizza had some sort of heavy object on top because the cheese stuck to the box when I opened it. The crust was plain, no garlic topping.",2 years ago,Closed,1000806739

Johnny Joestar,2.0,Not a true Pizza Hut restaurant.  No salad bar and no beer.  The beer thing may be because of it being on Maryland.  The menu was very limited and the server was not very friendly.  We would have had a better experience taking it home.,3 years ago,Closed,1000806739
