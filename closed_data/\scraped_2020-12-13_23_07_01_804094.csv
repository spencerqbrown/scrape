Elizabeth Gallagher,5.0,"Out of the dozen or so places you can get pizza at in Brookings, Marco's has outdone them all and keeps me coming back. If you like thin crust pizza, you won't find a better place in town. The food is always great, and the staff is really friendly and engaging. Would literally give this place 6 out of 5 stars if I could.",3 years ago,Closed,2000701580
