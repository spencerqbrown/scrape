debra minor,3.0,I love dominos pizza.  I just didn't appreciate the fact that the cook didn't have a mask on. All the other workers had their masks on. It was bad enough he didn't have gloves on but not to have a mask on  is not right.  This is not going to stop me from going to dominos.  But I think that they need to be more careful,5 months ago,Open,1000927502
