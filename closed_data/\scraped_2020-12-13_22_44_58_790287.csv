Jessica Stearns,1.0,I’ve had too many bad experiences to count at this point. A few weeks ago my pizza box was soaked in oil that had spilled out of the box from my breadsticks. Tonight I ordered at 11pm and it is now 12:20 and my pizza has still not been delivered even though the estimated time was 40-50 min. This location is the absolute worst.,a year ago,Closed,1000963450
Larry Kramer,5.0,"Don't get Papa John's very often, but when we do it's a treat.  Wish they were in our area.
