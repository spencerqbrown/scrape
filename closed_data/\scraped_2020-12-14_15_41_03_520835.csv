Allen Passmore,5.0,"I love this pizza! Great food, great prices and if something is a little off they go out of their way to make it right. Above and beyond! Best pizza in town!",2 years ago,Closed,2000737993
lawtonokiedude,1.0,"Subpar pizza at most. Most of the staff were either slacking off or yelling at each other over orders. I've seen some chaotic restaurants in my 20+ years as an executive chef, but this place takes the cake. I would give it zero stars if I could. Save your money and try somewhere else.",2 years ago,Closed,2000737993
