rhonda vaughan,5.0,Friendly and fun staff. Appears that employees enjoy their job and they work together well. Food was ready in just a short wait time and pizza was delicious. Prices are very good. I love being able to use the drive-thru service which means a lot to me as I am handicapped.,2 years ago,Closed,2000027245
Richard Seth,1.0,"Overall the staff is pretty nice. The unfortunate part is that our order is consistently wrong. If you're ordering the menu standard items, you should be fine. If you need anything custom then I would say your chances are 50/50 at best. We'll probably go back to Geppetto's. It's more money but, at least you get what you ordered.",3 years ago,Closed,2000027245

David M,1.0,"Suppose to be ""hot and ready"". NEVER is. Place is ridiculous now. You have to wait in line at least 20-30 min every time. They never have pizzas ready. Place has really gone downhill over the past few months. Use to go all the time, never again.",2 years ago,Closed,2000027245

Zachary Vause,1.0,If you like having your order take forever an getting food poisoning then I‚Äôd definitely recommend this place.
