Elizabeth Vyka,5.0,I get the same mini pizza made for me in about 10 minutes. The young people that work here are genuinely nice. They have a small eat in area. Chester's chicken is just the next counter over. Both are consistent in being fresh and tasty. I love fried okra too.,a year ago,Open,2000500712
Michelle Barrett,4.0,"The pizza is good and the service is very good. I suggest ordering ahead for anything other than a personal pizza. Personal pizzas are always hot and ready. The wait for a large is ten to fifteen minutes. We usually order our pizza, then â€¦More",a year ago,Open,2000500712

Amani,3.0,"The pizza is great!! I enjoyed my meal, but for some odd reason, I felt like my food tasted a little off. After it cooled off for a while the taste went away.",a year ago,Open,2000500712
Christina Hernandez,4.0,Pizza was good. They usually make it better. Only downfall was they said 20 min so I made it there in 25. But still had to wait 10 more min for one of the pizzas to come out. So the other one ended up being kinda cold by the time I got home. But its attached to a huge truck stop gas station so they do get pretty busy,2 years ago,Open,2000500712

Justin Johnson,2.0,I thought the point of having a pizza place in a gas station was to always have food ready for the traveler that's in a rush.  There was no pizzas up and it was 8 pm.  There was some other types of food but I went to a pizza joint wanting pizza.  Get it together imo.,2 years ago,Open,2000500712
