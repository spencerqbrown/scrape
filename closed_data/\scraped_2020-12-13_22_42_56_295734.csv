bow one,3.0,"Order was processed later than the stated on-line time. And the pizza seemed light on toppings. I'm a regular customer and today's experience was average at best. Customer service face-time was great as usual, friendly staff.",a year ago,Closed,2000631873
Alex Harris,3.0,"More of a 3.5, I've been a very regular customer at this location. Few things to keep it from a 5. I've been called twice later at night saying they were closing, it was 12:30 and online and store says 3am. Okay. I tried ordering online â€¦More",a year ago,Closed,2000631873
David Chambers,3.0,"Pizza is hit or miss. I have had several pizzas where the crust accounts for way too much of the pizza; the toppings and cheese stopped several inches from the edge.

Amanda Rosemark,1.0,"We've been ordering from this location for years, but it's been on the steady decline. There is little consistency to the quality and sadly as of late is usually not good. A few months ago we got food poisoning from their chicken wings and â€¦More",a year ago,Closed,2000631873

Jenne Siltberg,2.0,"Came an hour after ordering instead of 40 minutes. Forgot receipt to tip. Slower delivery and smaller portions vs sarpinos or Domino's. I work late shift and want to go to bed. My food arrived room temperature! I put it in fridge, good night ðŸ˜©",2 years ago,Closed,2000631873

Alex Burton,2.0,"Service was fine, but when i got home i opened the pizza to find half of the toppings are missing. When you order a specialty pizza it ends up pretty dissapointing for flavor without half the ingredients. Overall fail.",a year ago,Closed,2000631873
