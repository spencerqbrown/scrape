Jacob Watkins,1.0,"I work for Bradley down the street, they had just dropped off a 50% off coupon for the rest of the month (august). We at the dealer called to place the order, David the employee who answered told me I need a code or there's nothing he can do. We're all now enjoying Papa Johns at the dealership",2 years ago,Closed,2000591553

One guy was picking his nose and another ran his hands through his hair, all while touching the pizza. I quit the next day.
