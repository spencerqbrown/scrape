Brenda Bowden,2.0,It's a shame that the Edgecombe county Pizza Inn in Rocky Mount is so neglected from the owners. It's obviously not as important to them as the one on the Nash county side of Rocky Mount. ‚Ä¶More,2 years ago,Closed,1000823514
Emily Alvarez,1.0,The buffet is horrible small selections the pizza is cold not very tasteful the salad bar is terrible everything is very dry! I spent way to much $9.50 a person. That is honestly not worth it. I wouldn't recommend. Just drive about 10 mins to the grandsons buffet and you'll get your money's worth.,a year ago,Closed,1000823514
