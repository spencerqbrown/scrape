Priscilla Miller,4.0,"Lunch buffet is $5.79.  Good bang for the buck.  Staff is good about putting out whatever you ask for.  The pizza quality is good.   The salad bar is a little lacking, but not bad.  If you do order from the menu during lunch buffet, it does seem to take additional time.",a year ago,Closed,1000813026
Imjin Scout,5.0,"The food was great. The service by a hard working skeleton crew was great. Unfortunately they are closing this full service location next Tuesday for a drive thru or delivery only store. Long time servers will be forced to become cooks or drivers, or just go home.

Tunacrusade,3.0,Better than most pizza huts. I had a bad experience with getting pizza delivered warm so I just pick it up now since it's like 5 minutes from my house. I would recommend picking your order up. It gets a little dodgy if you ask them to deliver it.,a year ago,Closed,1000813026
