ryan walsh,1.0,"It is a shame that the service is so awful because the food is not too shabby. Each time I have been back hopeful that the service would match that of opening week, I have been left in utter dissapointment. Doubt I will be back. Seems to be the makings of yet another failed business in this location.",5 years ago,Closed,2000635615
