Alia Chaudhri,1.0,If I could give zero stars I would. This place is the biggest joke of a restaurant ever. They gave me a thin crust pizza and refused to admit their mistake. I had ordered a pan. Called them and they me told …More,2 years ago,Closed,2000424736
Marian Gladden,4.0,"Overall, the pizza was delicious and filling. The crust was not too thin and not too thick, and perfectly cooked. The sauce tasted unique although I prefer a bit more spice in my sauce. Good and efficient service too",a year ago,Closed,2000424736
Raj Jayanthi,5.0,"I am rating the service not the pizza. My son loves their pizza, but not me. I am very pleased with the service. They were courteous, professional and friendly. When I placed the order, a discount didn't apply. He helped me fix it. Another …More",3 years ago,Closed,2000424736
Dylan Lowery,1.0,"Ordered a pizza that never came. Was assured by staff three times that the pizza was ""on its way"". After hours had passed, I asked for a refund since I ordered online. Was told to call back later. Was charged anyway and it took a week and to get my money back. Will never order from here again.",2 years ago,Closed,2000424736
Joe Sumanth,5.0,I live nearby and it's easier to pickup.  Delivery fee is overpriced.  They make it quick and keep it warmed until picked up.  I'm also impressed at how their quality and options of style and flavor of pizza increased.  Much better than Dominos.,3 years ago,Closed,2000424736

Erica Wilson,1.0,They don’t answer the phone when you call. When you go to pick up they are just sitting around and playing. They act like they don’t want to take your order. When you get your order they mess it up and get an attitude when you want them to fix it or have your money back.,2 years ago,Closed,2000424736

The first time we were told the manager was in the bathroom so she couldn’t take our order, and asked us to call back in 5 minutes. 5 minutes later we call back, and she can’t take our order because she can’t get the computer to work and than hangs up on us.
