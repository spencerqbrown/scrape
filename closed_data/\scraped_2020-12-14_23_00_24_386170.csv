David Little,4.0,Good place to bring the kids for pizza and games.  The pizza is good quality unlike other similar places.  The game selection is somewhat limited but still decent for smaller kids and toddlers. The staff has always been friendly and the place is clean.

Stan Thomasson,5.0,Came here for our grandson's birthday party. The mom is very busy so it was nice to have a place that can take care of everything for the party.
