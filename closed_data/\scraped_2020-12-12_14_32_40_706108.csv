Anthony Raynor,5.0,Pleasantly surprised.  I had the Italian. The sandwich was generous in size.  The bread was soft with a crisp crust.  Good meat with lots of vegetables. The oil and vinegar provides a nice bite.  Only negative was they included tomato when I asked for it to be without.  Then again that happens almost all of the time at all restaurants.,4 years ago,Closed,1000822516
Sanmit Adhikari,4.0,"This is a great place to get delicious grilled sandwiches. I usually go for the large chicken vermonter or the steak bomb sandwich, and it was well worth the $9. It can easily feed two people. â€¦More",2 years ago,Closed,1000822516
Jennifer Rajaseharan,5.0,The most juiciest sandwiches ever! A large sandwich can easily feed two people. Order the steak no. 9! A large sandwich is about 10$ with tax.. And they have great deals now.. Buy 2 get 1 free..,5 years ago,Closed,1000822516
James Doyle,4.0,"Average D'Angelo location with all the standard sandwich offerings and a fast-food vibe as it is counter service and located within the larger Cambridgeside Galleria mall food court. Short walk from the MBTA ""green line"" Lechmere subway station. Paid parking in the garage below the mall.",2 years ago,Closed,1000822516
Nicholas Demusz,1.0,"The cleanliness of this place and quality of meat is extremely disturbing, after a couple bites of my sandwich I realized it was riddled with hairs. Will not be returning. Strongly discourage eating here if you value your health.",2 years ago,Closed,1000822516

john lewis,1.0,"This place is horrible. I've been at a job across the street for 5 weeks and they give me different prices for stuff that's not on the menu (like side salads) every other day. The manager just told me a side, not small, is only supposed to be .89 less than a large. How does that make sense.",5 years ago,Closed,1000822516
