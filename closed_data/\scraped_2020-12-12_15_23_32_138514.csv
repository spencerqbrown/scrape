Ed Prendergast,1.0,Worse pizza I've  experienced. They added water to sauce with much garlic salt for taste. Thin watery  stained sauce leaked out when you held pizza up to place it in your mouth. You really  need to check on that sight. Thank you.,a year ago,Closed,2000003498
Zona Man,1.0,It taste like a pancake with sauce cheese and toppings on it. It was so bad. The service was extremely terrible. The older lady did not care at all and I think she is the manager.
