Mark English,4.0,The lobby where you wait for your order isn't heated.  I froze while I waited!  The pizza was okay and the crazy cinnamon pieces were okay as well.( too sweet).,2 years ago,Closed,2000172733
Travis,2.0,Stop by on a Wednesday night and they changed their hours. You can no longer get a pizza after 8 PM. Really lousy move. The hours on Google are no longer current. â€¦More,a year ago,Closed,2000172733
Everyday Ghost,1.0,"Disgusting. First the staff is the farthest thing from professional. Second the location got a makeover and new ownership, but the food quality got worse. This time I found hair in my pizza. Like seriously, that's just gross. You shouldn't be in business if you can't even provide food without the hair of your staff. Terrible.",2 years ago,Closed,2000172733
