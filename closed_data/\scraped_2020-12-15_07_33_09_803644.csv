Heather Knightson,1.0,"My number one complaint is the unsanitary reuse of plates here.  Buffets are supposed to provide a clean plate every time; you have to ask here,  and so people were just reusing plates,  touching serving utensils to used dirty plates, â€¦More",2 years ago,Closed,2000630639
Zx2Nick,3.0,I didn't like the pizza. Parts of it was undercooked. The place is large good enough to host a party for several families. Most of the employees were really nice but one in particular (cashier) needs an attitude adjustment.,2 years ago,Closed,2000630639
Christian Cubacub,4.0,"The food tastes pretty good, but the things are pricey... especially drinks! The service is alright, waiting times can be long.

Amanda Fetaui,3.0,I think Shakey's is alright. It's not comparable to Chuck Cheese though. I gave it a 3 stars being that it never fails to give my kids a good time even with the small selection of games. It also entertains my husband when they have a game â€¦More,6 years ago,Closed,2000630639
