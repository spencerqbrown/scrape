Ronald Butt,4.0,Good prices for the pizza. Can park in parking lot nearby. Staff is friendly. Plenty of specials to choose from. Problem in the past with opening late seems to be fixed with new management. Easily spotted from the street near Foodtown and near train station. Staff seems a little sparse. They do deliver in the neighborhood.,2 years ago,Closed,2000172926
