Ameen Karim,3.0,"When you describe a fast service pizza place, you have to treat it exactly like that. The staff is nice, sometimes they don't get the portions right for a good pizza (too much sauce/cheese, etc). This ruins the experience. Their cheese ball â€¦More",a year ago,Closed,2000749258
Jon von Ahnen,5.0,"My favorite eatery on campus!  But could you all stop reaching over the glass with your dirty hands to point at what toppings you want?!  Just tell the nice people...they'll make it happen!  Tasty pizza, friendly employees...but really busy during peak times.  It's good, so that's predictable : )",8 months ago,Closed,2000749258
Maribeth Capelli,4.0,Got the Keto crust red vino pizza with sausage on it. It was decent. Crust was very thin and was crumbly and couldn't hold the weight of the already light pizza. Paid $13 and was a small meal split between 2 people. Decent for having keto on demand. There are still some carbs in it though. Staff was good.,9 months ago,Closed,2000749258

Alina Garcia,3.0,Pizza and breadsticks are alright because there is an overwhelming presence of oil. I couldnâ€™t eat the entire pizza because the oil was too fattening. However the flavor was still good. The staff were attentive when explaining how the service works.,2 years ago,Closed,2000749258
