Michelle Luna,5.0,"As i was giving my order, expecting to pay listed price, the gentleman let me know of the deals they had and how upsizing would save me money. I left paying less than what i expected,  and with more food than i had planned on taking home. I was more than pleased with the service, and the pizza was delicious.  Definitely worth the drive.",2 years ago,Closed,2000329574
