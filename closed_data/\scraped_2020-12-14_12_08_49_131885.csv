Sam Dayton,1.0,"Arrived here to get some food and they only had cheese pizzas, I will not return to this place of business period. Also I will advise my family and friends to also boycott this place. My suggestion if you want pizza go somewhere else. Poor business.",2 years ago,Closed,2000393570

Melissa Johnson,4.0,I would recommend calling in your pizza to be cooked fresh. When they cook it fresh it is awesome but if you get pre-made with the hot and ready it's not good because it sits so long,2 years ago,Closed,2000393570

Corey McGovern,4.0,"I stopped in for a couple quick pizzas for dinner, the staff was a little frazzled as it was unusually busy and they had some large orders go out and had some new people working the back.
