Zach,3.0,"We love the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, but it really is overpriced.  If the pizza was about $5 less, it would be more reasonable.  Also, their onions on the pizza are almost completely raw and seem like they were just picked from the garden.  Lower your prices a bit and cook your veggies first.",a year ago,Closed,1000827361

Zach Dolan,3.0,"I find this pizza to be overpriced and too soft. It's not thin enough for folding, but not thick enough to hold its own weight and the crust somewhat oddly reminds me of a croissant.
