Chris Brooks,1.0,I've slowly watched the decline of this location. Great pizza but this store has no staff. I've ordered via the app and the pizza is never ready when I arrive. There's usually a line of people waiting due to the lack of staff here. Thankfully there are other locations nearby.,2 years ago,Closed,2000588326
Roy Minjarez,5.0,I think papa Murphy is one of the best pizza out there. They always put plenty of toppings and there sauce is great. Never been disappointed in their flavors.,3 years ago,Closed,2000588326

newtheis,2.0,"My first visit, the pizza was delicious and the service was good. My second time was a waste. I walked in, but apparently had no salads.

Brandon Roding,4.0,"The store is almost always staffed with attentive, courteous folks, but sometimes volume in the store can get crazy.  One tip: Absent a line, it's faster to visit the location, order, pay and receive pizza than it is to place an order on the app (bundling in their mandatory 30-minute gap between order and pickup).",3 years ago,Closed,2000588326
