David San Antonio,4.0,My sandwich was good and the service was friendly. I prefer subway if getting a sub because you can pick each individual ingredient as they put it on. But if you want a quick burger or something different D’Angelos has more options.,2 years ago,Closed,1000822271

Timberly Matonic,5.0,"This place has delicious sandwiches with fresh, fluffy bread.  The workers are friendly and the prices are close to Subway's but this is better food and service.  I love the tuna salad.",3 years ago,Closed,1000822271

Dain Council,1.0,"Every time i go in here i wait 30+ minutes for a sub and the employees are rude and discuss personal issues openly infront of customers. Clearly, management at this store is lacking severely. You could probably get a meal faster at the common man around the corner.",2 years ago,Closed,1000822271

Trevor Ballinger,3.0,"Subs are amazing.... when they do actually deliver. I have ordered multiple times and at least 5-6 times in the last few monthes, they call and say they don’t have a delivery driver for today. Then I have to wait a week for my money to be returned back. Just a little annoying. Need to hire more staff.",3 years ago,Closed,1000822271
