Jeff Waldrop,4.0,"Staff.... super friendly.  Pizza....excellent.  I'd give 5 stars but theres misques from time to time with how many extras, like sauces, thy hat are ordered vs how many actually make it in the box.

Yoosteen,4.0,"Nice little pizza shop. Everything was made where you can visually see and they bake the pizza while you wait. Sure everyone would want their order as soon as they placed it, but just knowing it was made fresh, is good. It wasn't the …More",3 years ago,Closed,1000968737

stephanie schafer,1.0,I live not even a minute away and when I get a notification that my pizza is on its way it still takes a half hour to get there and shows up cold.  It's really to bad you're the only pizza place that delivers. Guess I should start using uber eats. At least their food shows up hot.,2 years ago,Closed,1000968737
Annie Smith,5.0,"I just placed an order for delivery with a Papa John's employee named Ariel. Probably the best interaction with a person at a food joint since moving to Washington 7 months ago. Extremely kind and helpful. Very, very appreciated.",3 years ago,Closed,1000968737

Tina WestMontalbano,1.0,Just say no.  Do not order pizza here. You will be waiting forever and a year for a pizza. The service is horrible and slow. I have given this restaurant over 5 tries to get it right. They can't! They leave you on hold and forget you are on hold. I rather eat a PB &J and call it a night. I am so over pizza in this state.,a year ago,Closed,1000968737
Reflective Auto Detailing,1.0,"Horrible pizza, very rude employee and manager after they messed up the pizza order for me and my hungry 9 yr old son.
