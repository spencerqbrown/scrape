Christopher Anderson,1.0,"Closed temporarily according to a sign on the Aurora location, but no signage here. Also, no start date on the sign left on the Aurora location, so it's hard to tell when it will be open again. I tried calling the number, and I got the ""number has been disconnected"" message.
