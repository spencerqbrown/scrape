Abby DuMoulin,1.0,"We used to order once a week and had good pizza, hot most of the time... but this last experience was TERRIBLE! We waited over two hours to receive COLD pizza in smashed boxes. The store wouldn’t remake pizzas or do anything to try and help us. It was the worst customer service and pizza ever. We are so disappointed.",2 years ago,Closed,2000631906
Snow Grimlin,5.0,They have great customer service and an awesome staff team. They have awesome food. I ordered wings and pizza and they came out perfectly as well as within a perfect time range. By far the best place to grab a bite of pizza or some wings.,2 years ago,Closed,2000631906

Jana Berghoff,2.0,Pizza had great flavor and I think I really would have liked it but it came with no warmth at all.  I understand delivered pizza may not be hot but I do expect delivered pizza to be at least warm.,2 years ago,Closed,2000631906
Laura Potter,1.0,"We ordered pizza and  bacon sticks. The marinara sauce I had was a dark color. My husband's and daughter's sauces looked normal. Mine seemed to taste ok so I didn't think anything of it. 6 hours later I started having severe stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. 3 days later and I'm still sick. Last time we eat there.",2 years ago,Closed,2000631906
Stephen Hirn,5.0,"Great customer service. We got stuck in traffic on our way to pickup, they remade our pizzas without us even asking or thinking that might be a problem. Very polite staff make you feel like you made the right choice for pizza.",3 years ago,Closed,2000631906

Carolyn Miller,5.0,"I love this place. I agree that I’ve had issues sometimes just getting the sauces that I ask for, but other than that I’ve never had any issues. The quality of this place is so much better than dominoes, Pizza Hut or Papa Johns so im happy …More",2 years ago,Closed,2000631906
Karen Pederson,4.0,"Unique Pizzas! The pizza's get 5 stars.  (Tater tots with nacho cheese sauce, mac and cheese pizza).  They also have wings, which were a little soggy, which is a pet peeve of mine.  Didn't bother the others in my group.",4 years ago,Closed,2000631906

Tony Leif,3.0,Tater tot pizza had slightly overcooked tots. They were chewy instead of crispy. Topper classic was real good. Buffalo pizza didn't have a strong Buffalo flavor.,4 years ago,Closed,2000631906
Rita Sandstrom,3.0,"It's close to us and the pizza is good, but their prices are high. We bought a medium tonight because they have a 1/2 online coupon. We paid $9.12 - which means that little medium pizza would have been almost $18 full price!",3 years ago,Closed,2000631906
Adam Emanoff,4.0,"So tasty! Tater tot pizza is the way to go. Delivery or pickup has been quick, but more importantly they're on time. Delivery guesstimate has been spot on, every time.",3 years ago,Closed,2000631906

"Georgia Begin, Esq.",1.0,"First and last time I'll go here. Walked in to order they said it would take 25-30 minutes. 45 minutes later and we are still waiting, and they messed up my order. Meanwhile, the phone is ringing off the hook and even when the employees were not super busy, they didn't answer it- it rang almost the entire time we sat there.",4 years ago,Closed,2000631906
