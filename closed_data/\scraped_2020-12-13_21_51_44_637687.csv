Eric Cruz,5.0,Tried the beyond meat sausage pizza. Was pretty amazed on the quality and taste of the plant based sausage. Would be better if I could build my own pizza with it in any size instead of large only. Maybe in the future,4 weeks ago,Open,2000463759

joe mcalexander,3.0,"Pizza is subpar but depending on coupons or current deals it can be cheap enough to become worth while. Some of the crust flavoring options are fairly good but in general the crust leaves alot to desire. Toppings are pretty standard as far as fast food pizza goes. Sauce could use some improvement, maybe a Spicier option or something.",a year ago,Open,2000463759
