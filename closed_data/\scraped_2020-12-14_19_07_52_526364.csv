Allan Conner,1.0,Got a large pizza and it had areas with no cheese on it. Like multiple 2 inch wide sections. The areas that did have cheese were very thin. We paid full price for the pizza too. Extremely disappointed.,a year ago,Closed,2000443375

AlaskanFox,2.0,"Extremely double check your order because I asked for a small pizza, and they gave me this full on greased up pizza. It was terrible and I got my money back from that. The whole pizza just full of grease.",2 years ago,Closed,2000443375
