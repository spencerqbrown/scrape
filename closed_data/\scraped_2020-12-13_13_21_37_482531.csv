C Williams,3.0,When this location first opened up I loved it. The customer service use to be top notch and the pizzas were always fresh and hot. Now the customer service sucks like the rest of the locations in macon. The pizzas are dry and you're lucky if its not dark and crispy!,a year ago,Closed,2000242696

Jeff Tilley,4.0,"Friday night. Phoned ahead for 6 pizzas. They were ready on my arrival. Friendy staff. Cheese and pepperoni pizzas were great. 3 meat pizzas were over cooked, meats were hard. Should have looked at them before I left. Still wish they would put a little more sauce on their pizzas. Overall, good deal.",a year ago,Closed,2000242696
Stephen Morgan,3.0,"Ordered pizza online at 7pm waited in the lobby for a full hour after talking to the employees twice, and was then told they forgot about the order.

Caitlin Tidwell,5.0,"I'm not sure what changes they made after moving to this new location, but it is 100% better. From the employee's attitudes all the way to the freshness of the pizza.

Brianna Harker,3.0,I've called in twice and both times the order wasn't even started before I got there (15 minutes after ordering) the food is good but don't bother calling ahead.

Timeka Murphy,2.0,"Went to get pizzas on New Year's Day. Cashier, Shiquita P., was in a very nasty attitude saying, ""I'm the only one here, I gotta a lot of online orders to fill and a lot of call-in orders to fill first, so I'll get to you when I can!"" She …More",a year ago,Closed,2000242696
