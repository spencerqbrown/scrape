sapno ki,5.0,Pizza was really good. I went there with 100 dollar bill. My car was too far to walk and they didn't have change for 100. The manger of the day was so nice to give me two medium pizzas for free. Customer service was great and welcoming employees.,2 years ago,Closed,2000745488

Marissa Gilman,2.0,"Would have given more stars if the ""expected"" delivery time was more accurate. Got a confirmation stating 6:02p and the pizza didn't arrive until after 6:40p. We called at 6:15 and were told the driver had just left 5 minutes ago and we â€¦More",2 years ago,Closed,2000745488

Philip Bader,4.0,"Literally every employee in this store was stoned, without exception.  Pizza was pretty good though.  Minus a star because the guy behind the register was pretty rude but, as I said, he was clearly high as a kite and my order was correct.",2 years ago,Closed,2000745488
David Pedersen,1.0,Food quality has gone way downhill.  Last 2 delivery orders took well over an hour when the estimated delivery time was 35 min.  Asked driver what was going on and was told management is a mess.  Too bad.  This used to be much better so I believe it must be a management issue.,2 years ago,Closed,2000745488
Jennifer Kikta,4.0,Our go to pizza place. So close to our house. They are very quick. Only 4 stars because at times the pizza is cold (even when picked up on time). the Nacho cheese could be warmed up - its served cold.,2 years ago,Closed,2000745488

Bach Zeng,3.0,I've ordered twice from this place. The pizza ain't bad especially the buffalo chicken but both times I've had the same driver who was just rude and unwelcoming.  The last time I ordered cinnamon sticks and it looked like someone dropped the box upside down  and didn't care. It was fine to eat but it came in a horrible presentation.,2 years ago,Closed,2000745488
