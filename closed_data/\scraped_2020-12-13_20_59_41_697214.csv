Richard Barniak,5.0,Papa Murphy's pizza is always a nice change from the rim of the mill pizza.  Being fresh is so good. The kids who work there are always pleasant and polite.  Highly recommended.  If you want more than one meal for a couple.  Get the 5 meat stuffed pizza with green peppers and onions. Best pizza in town for the value.,a year ago,Closed,1000900429
