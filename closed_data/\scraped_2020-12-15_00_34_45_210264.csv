William Anderson,5.0,"We have so far tried the garlic chicken pizza and the papas favorite (everything) pizza. Both were very, very good! I really like using the app after I get off of work on my way home. When I get there I just walk in and pick it up and take it home. We now have a weekly pizza night with Papa Murphyâ€™s Pizza!",a year ago,Closed,2000334466
Phyllis Leclair,5.0,Love their pizzas!  They almost never lack in toppings.  I also like the fact that I can cook them myself at home so when itâ€™s time to eat the pizza is hot.  We get original crust & it cooks up in about 10-12 minutes.  Most of their personnel is very pleasant!  Restaurant looks very clean.,a year ago,Closed,2000334466
