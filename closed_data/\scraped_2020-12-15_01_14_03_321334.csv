Carmelita Henley,5.0,Service is amazing. Always have had kind and efficient servers. Cozy neighborhood vibe. Prices are very reasonable and the food is great! I'd recommend the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich and all the pizzas are amazing.,5 years ago,Closed,2000244135
Jacob Miller,3.0,Nice staff. The place is a bit run down though. Pizza was a bit greasy too. Salad bar was okay. They have a cool soda machine.,3 years ago,Closed,2000244135
Robert Roberts,5.0,I try to go here every couple weeks with my dad. Always tastes great and when you ask for a topping they cover your pizza in it. Most places just tease me with the toppings barely putting any on. All ingredients taste very fresh including the dough.,8 years ago,Closed,2000244135

Sandra Lopez,5.0,"Amazing pizza with a lot of flavor. Which ever toppings u add, they make sure they over load the pizza with it. To bad it is expensive a bit. Worth to try it that's for sure",6 years ago,Closed,2000244135
