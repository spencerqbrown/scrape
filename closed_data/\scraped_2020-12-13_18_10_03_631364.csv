Aaron Hinton,1.0,Just left there at 2:30 on 5/24.  Horrible service. Asked a simple question and the food.  The woman and the man both working there rude hateful people.  I tried to be polite despite their attitudes and it didn’t help.  Never go there again. Don’t bother. Not to mention the pizza tasted like it’s been there all day,a year ago,Open,2000611012
