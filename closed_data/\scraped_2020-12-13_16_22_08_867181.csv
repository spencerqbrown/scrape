Amber Allen,4.0,Pizza is really good when it's fresh. You can order special pizzas so that helps. There's always a coupon somewhere for a discount. And kids under three eat free. This is a great place for groups who can't agree on one pizza or picky kids.,3 years ago,Closed,1000822974
Asia Cartwright,3.0,It's good for what it is for. A place to entertain and feed picky children who only like pasta and pizza. If judged on that alone it would receive 5 stars but considering I am an adult it fails to impress. The food is edible but it stops there. The desert was lacking at best. But my children love it. For that thank you CiCi's.,7 years ago,Closed,1000822974
