Devin Olson,3.0,Decent service but feels like the store where they send employees to train because most people seem like they're new to the restaurant service or it's their first job. Except for one employee who seems to be a master at her job and seems definitely loyal. I think her name was Alisha? A small little blonde with a super cute smile!,2 years ago,Closed,2000030494
