Angela Duby,5.0,"Love their stuffed crust! It is pretty much two pizzas on top of each other. The stuffed crust pizza's are around $18 each, but they are worth it! Most times, one slice will fill me up while I can eat 4-5 slices before filling up of Little Caesars pizza.",a year ago,Closed,2000588314
Art Harrington,5.0,"Came here for the first time a few weeks ago and love the pizza. I walked out with two pizzas. I have a Camp Chef Smoker and cooked my pizza in it. I was very impressed with the results, especially how well a smoker can cook a pizza. I may …More",2 years ago,Closed,2000588314
Cliff Martinet,5.0,Great pizza. Gourmet veggie is fantastic and I say that as a meat lover. Really surprising how good take and bake can be. Our oven bakes them on the fast side so keep an eye on it!,a year ago,Closed,2000588314
Christopher Schlacta,1.0,"I was shocked and pleased to find a Papa Murphy's still operating in the area, as I've been craving a proper Brokeback Pizza (A cowboy, covered in creamy white sauce), but I called them up today to confirm it was real and I got the tritone ""The number you're trying to reach is no longer in service"" :(",a year ago,Closed,2000588314
Nissim Menashe,5.0,"First time ordering! A very unique way of buying pizza. They make it to your specific way, you take it home to bake. This is going to be a new norm. The difference between frozen and fresh! Fresh tastes so much better! You gotta try it!",2 years ago,Closed,2000588314
Brian Solbrig,5.0,"I am a huge fan of Papa Murphy's. Their pizza is bomb as hell and the cookie dough is delicious. I've never been to a ""bad"" Papa Murphy's, but this location is exceptional. The staff is courteous and friendly and the owner is awesome. I definitely recommend checking this place out. You won't regret it!",3 years ago,Closed,2000588314

Murphy Williams,5.0,Papa Murphy's only offers take and bake at home pizza. It's best to order online. Seems like better deals then walk in ordering. The website is easy to use.  My favorite is the Chicken Garlic pizza. Not a fan of their traditional red sauce. They have prepared salads which are good for quick lunch. Take and bake desserts too.,4 years ago,Closed,2000588314

Matthew R,5.0,"Amazing in everyway! Order online, pick up at a time that is convenient. Bring coupons and save a few bucks off the order, and complete a phone survey for some yummy cookie dough!
