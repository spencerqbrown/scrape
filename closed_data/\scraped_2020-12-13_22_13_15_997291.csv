Dina Abdel,3.0,"Pizza hut not my favorite place to go to eat pizza, but they have good pizza. They have good service and very nice employees. The parking lot and the restaurant is small. The only thing is that they need to clean the floors good.",5 years ago,Closed,1000816891
Haroon Tanveer,1.0,"The only relatively good aspect was the pizza. Service was terrible. The restaurant was empty, however it took over an hour for the pizza to get made. Many of the tables were dirty and the place did not have a welcoming feel to it.",5 years ago,Closed,1000816891
