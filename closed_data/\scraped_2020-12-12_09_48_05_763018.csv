Eric Blais,4.0,"Good pizza at a decent price. I am not a fan of the minimum purchase amount to qualify for delivery, also the customer service over the phone needs serious improvement. I waited on hold for over 9 minutes just to place an order. However, because of that I did get my pizza for free after some polite haggling on my part.",a year ago,Open,2000407388
Dave Zetti,4.0,"Love the food and always fast service! The new assistant Ken is great! He introduced himself, was helpful, and made an excellent pizza for my kids and I.
