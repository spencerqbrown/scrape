Erin Vicha,2.0,"Good pizza, although not quite what I remembered from my childhood. The manager was really nice, but the girl at the counter wasn't doing a very good job. We ordered all you can eat pizza and the whole process of ordering it is just dumb. …More",3 years ago,Closed,1000862472
Michael McAfee,3.0,We went at a slow time and yet it took a very long time to get our order and the staff never appologized for the long wait. When placing the order the cashier stated it would be 12-15 minutes... 36 minutes later we finally got our to go order. Food was hot but as far as taste was just ok.,2 years ago,Closed,1000862472

Tyler Green,1.0,"Pizza came out pretty fast. But in exchange, the pizza had about as much taste as pizza sauce on cardboard. Honestly it might be the worst pizza place in Fitchburg. Service was nice, but lacks decent taste in the pizza.",4 years ago,Closed,1000862472

Pastor John,4.0,"I'm from NY and know Pizza.  We've tried most places around Fitchburg, and nothing against the Greeks, but it's not Italian pizza.  Pappa Gino's comes the closest hands down to good Italian thin crust pizza.  The crust could have a little more taste, but otherwise, wouldn't go anywhere else.",5 years ago,Closed,1000862472
