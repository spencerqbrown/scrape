John Farnor,5.0,"We ordered a mushroom pizza and we're happy with the service and the pizza.  The young woman who took our order made us feel like we were her favorite customers.  Before she started to prepare the pizza, she made sure to wash her hands, a nice and comforting touch.  Whenever we're in the area we will go back to that Little Caesars.",a year ago,Closed,2000393778

Austin Mitchell,4.0,I have never gotten delivery from here but have picked up orders multiple times.  The service is kind of slow when you are picking up and many times the hot and ready are not ready but take about 5 min so that isn't a big deal.  The pretzle crust pizza is the bomb though that's for real.,a year ago,Closed,2000393778
