Adam Nichols,5.0,"Now that Pizza Hut has stopped issuing decent coupons, even after submitting reviews (as they used to), Godfather's Express is by far the best pizza (for the price) in Platte City. It is consistently delicious every time we order it! This is our GO-TO pizza place now! üçïüëç",2 months ago,Open,2000500716

Ken Denning,5.0,"Located in Phillips 66 gas station. Good pizza, Gluten Free crust was good, only in mini size. Allow at least 40 min-1hr for the GF crust pizza, frozen and needed to thaw.  I would ask for extra sauce next time though.  2 minis were just over $8.",4 years ago,Open,2000500716
