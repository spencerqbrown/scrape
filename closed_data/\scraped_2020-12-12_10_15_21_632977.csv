Thoughtful Reviews,5.0,Carryout location with friendly counter staff. Clean take-out counter and pick-up area and there is plenty of parking in the lot. They accept call-in as well as in-person counter orders and offer special pizza deals. Food is fresh and affordably priced. Nothing fancy here but consistent great tasting pizza.,2 years ago,Closed,2000393634

Thomas Nee,1.0,Went there today 10/2/2018 for lunch at 12:40. The doors were locked and no lights were on. Not the first time. The commercials say $5 pizza or $9 special and their prices are always a couple of $$ higher,2 years ago,Closed,2000393634
