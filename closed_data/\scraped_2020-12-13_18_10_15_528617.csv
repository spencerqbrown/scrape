Timothy Wyatt,5.0,"1st time experiencing GF pizza was in Anchorage, AK...1994.  By far a superior pie!!!  While visiting Lexington, we saw the sign and thought, No Freaking Way (PG version]!!!  Phenominal experience with the staff at this location and the pie was as we expected!!!  Wish we had a location in Tampa, FL!!!",a year ago,Open,2000611006
