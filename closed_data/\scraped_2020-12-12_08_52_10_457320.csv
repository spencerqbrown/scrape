j k,1.0,It has been a while since I have ordered a pizza from papa johns but I thought I would give it a shot.  I ordered a buffalo chicken pizzza but got a ranch pizza drizzled with a tiny bit of buffalo sauce and almost no chicken.  Ranch is gross.  Add chicken and buffalo sauce and you might have a winner.  I will try again in 5 years.,3 years ago,Closed,1000961161
