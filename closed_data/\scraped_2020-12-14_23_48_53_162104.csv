Karl k916,1.0,"If they say 45 mins. Expect it to be closer to 90 mins. This establishment can't seem to give a proper time frame. If it wasn't for the fact that it is papa John's pizza I would never buy from them again. They really need to retrain their employees, especially in time management.",2 years ago,Closed,2000023905

Princess of the Cape,5.0,"Hard to understand what everyone is complaining about - I've eaten here like 5 times now, and it is exactly what it was advertised as: Papa John's Pizza. It's a chain, folks - chains are pretty much identical.",2 years ago,Closed,2000023905

Rosalina Espinoza,2.0,Lady cared more about her food cost than me paying for the food. I wasn't aware that we couldn't use two promotions for one order. I asked if i can just do two transactions but said no cause it will mess up her food cost. So I left with nothing cause that wasn't good costumer service.,2 years ago,Closed,2000023905
