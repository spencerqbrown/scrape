Nick Maag,5.0,Very good deep dish pizza.  The garlic thing like other guy said was ok but tastes just like crazy bread but in they are in bites.  Be warned of you are picking up deep dish for home because it can leak with the gold holes in their box.  My picture is of the delicious deep dish and the leak.,4 years ago,Closed,2000635458
Lora Gauthier,2.0,"Tried the deep dish cheese. Sauce tasted great but this was the weirdest ""Chicago style"" pizza I've ever had. It was like shredded mozzarella was mixed into the sauce instead of a separate layer UNDER the sauce. Crust was pretty good. All the flavors were there, just a complete miss texture wise. I don't get it.",3 years ago,Closed,2000635458

Scott Brooks,1.0,The worst pizza experience I've ever had.  Tried to order online and the coupons they had sent in the mail did not work.  There were absolutely no parking spots when I got there at 5:15 for pick up (Custer and Eldorado).  Most places that ‚Ä¶More,6 years ago,Closed,2000635458

Brooklynn R.,5.0,Im from Chicago and I had this pizza today in Lewisville for a work related meeting. Without paying attention to the name I ate and at first bite tasted a bit of home. I googled a location that's luckily near where I actually live and will be ordering dinner for the family. Tonight I'll try the deep dish.,3 years ago,Closed,2000635458

Firefly,1.0,I'm from Chicago so I had high exceptions.  The beef is dry and skimpy.  Everything is overpriced.  The sausage is usually overcooked.  Delivery takes FOREVER even though we only order sandwiches.  We have ordered several times to try to ‚Ä¶More,5 years ago,Closed,2000635458
Joy Lawrence,3.0,For this Chicagoian who has been transferred down to McKinney I was elated to send a favorite eatery of ours. Unfortunately we ordered the cheesy beef which had no flavor and was very dry. The Italian beef was just the same.
