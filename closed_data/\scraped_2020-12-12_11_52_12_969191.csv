Zorrbabe,5.0,I am sorry to say to tell everybody this location has closed down I think they were going to make a speedy place bigger. It is a pure shame because I have had many good times here eating a salad bar and getting their various deals and it was a great family atmosphere. Bad decision to close this place.,2 years ago,Closed,1000807082
Dianne Griese,5.0,My 2 friends and I go here at least 1 time a week.  Buffet is wonderful and Rachel and cook are the best.  I do agree it does need updating.  Loved when they had the place mats.  Just makes it feel more clean.  Love the rewards program.,4 years ago,Closed,1000807082
Shawnee Ackley,5.0,"Ordered a mushroom pan pizza, very delicious. Restaurant could use a facelift, but it's an older location so it's understandable. The dining area was clean and tidy.
