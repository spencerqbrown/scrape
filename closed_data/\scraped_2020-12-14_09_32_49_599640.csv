Michael Vesely,1.0,Absolutely terrible. Ordered a pizza and 16 wings online and arrived 5 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. Ended up waiting another 20 minutes (45 in total). They said they gave us extra wings for the wait but it was only 3 extra. Everything was cold and the pizza was doughy trash. I should've gone with Little Caesar's.,a year ago,Closed,2000183013
