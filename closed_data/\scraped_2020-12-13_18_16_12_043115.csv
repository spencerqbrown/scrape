Sabrina,5.0,"Order here a a lot, I live on the other side of town, they always get my order here fast and it's always still nice and hot. Giovannis thats closer to me takes over an hour and half to get my order to me while my dads gets it here in less that 30 mins. and their pizza is way better as well. I only order from my dads now.",3 months ago,Open,1000926967
