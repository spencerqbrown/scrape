Hogfan3019,5.0,"Love this pizza. For chain pizza, this is my favorite. Some may complain about having to cook it yourself, but I love it. Hot, fresh pizza when I want, and a million times better than any frozen pizza that you would be cooking anyway.",2 years ago,Closed,2000588313
Nicole Rogers,4.0,I am disappointed to see this location on Summer Ave closed.  It was a once a week stop.  They also closed the store on Union that was close to work. Now I will have to find something else close to home.  The next closest store is 20 ‚Ä¶More,2 years ago,Closed,2000588313
