Zachery Bilger,4.0,Pizza was phenomenal. Marcos is my favorite and I have used locations all over Indy. The pizza was definitely on par with the high quality I've come to expect. The one less star is due to the restaurant being completely empty and still ‚Ä¶More,3 years ago,Closed,2000051284
Ileen weiner,5.0,Probably some of the best pizza on the north side of Indianapolis. You can select the amount of cheese & sauce. You can select the type of crust and different fresh ingredients from their menu! I would definitely recommend Marco's Pizza!,3 years ago,Closed,2000051284
Dave Handler,5.0,Myself being from NY I've never really been big on chain pizzeria places.  I have to admin that Marco's isn't to bad!  I've never had a bad experience at this location and if they did make a mistake the staff worked hard to make it right!  Guess that's why I've been coming back over and over again for the past 10 years!,a year ago,Closed,2000051284

Team Zuhlke,1.0,"Took a few attempts to get connected to someone who then was not able to complete our order.  The guy on the phone kept saying ""You're going to have to slow down""  We went through my phone number one slow digit at a time.  In the end, he couldn't get the promo code to work and was pretty rude about it.  No Marcos for us tonight.",2 years ago,Closed,2000051284
William Goins,1.0,"I was told it would be 60 minutes til my delivery.
