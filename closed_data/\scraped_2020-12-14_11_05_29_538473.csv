cathy williams,1.0,The two people that work there were wearing their masks under their noses. I didn't notice that until after I ordered or I wouldn't have.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. It was dry as a bone. The had obviously used the pizza sauce on the spaghetti. The meatballs were good but I wanted pasta with pasta sauce. No flavor... terrible.,3 months ago,Open,1000914830

Xavier Fernando,2.0,"Excellent food, but I could see the staff were using their cell phones and feeding themselves FINGERS TO MOUTH in the exact same location right in the heart of the kitchen where they made my food.
