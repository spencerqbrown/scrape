G M,5.0,"I don't know if this place went through a change of management or what, but they are doing a good job now. Delivery was earlier than estimated, the quality was good, the folks working phones AND delivery were both very professional and polite. It's nice to know that the Kirkland area finally has a good pizza delivery place now.",4 years ago,Closed,1000806953

Skyler Gonsalves,2.0,"Not good, not bad. Your standard Pizza Hut but with an awkward entrance and exit onto the main road. There are much better places nearby to eat, would recommend anything else but here.",8 years ago,Closed,1000806953

Brenda Osorio,1.0,This place has the worst service ever. Placed order online at 7:20 pm and said it would be ready for pick up by 7:40. I arrived by 8pm and it still wasnt ready until 8:25 and they gave me the wrong order and pizza was cold. Workers kept walking in and out the back and it smelled like weed.,5 years ago,Closed,1000806953
Toddthe206geek,1.0,Waited almost 20min before leaving.  No one checked on us after seating us.  I've also ordered online with the play store app and it took them an hour to deliver to my place which is at most 5min away.  This pizza hut has the worst service of any fast food restaurant i have ever seen.,5 years ago,Closed,1000806953
Emma Morris,1.0,"I gave up on ordering from this Pizza Hut. I lived right up the street and it would take 1.5+ hours for my pizza to arrive. When it did, the order was usually wrong or missing something. I can't count the times the delivery guy had to come back to fix my order or bring something he forgot.",4 years ago,Closed,1000806953
Chelsea Hellman,1.0,"If I could give zero stars, I would! this place is atrocious with service. They never deliver when they say they are. My pizza is either cold or the wrong order! I just ordered from them for the last time! I just got my pizza and it was ice cold!",5 years ago,Closed,1000806953
Lauren Hall-Stigerts,1.0,Ordered on the mobile app for pickup. Store sign says open until 11pm but it does not state that's only for delivery - I was told when I arrived the lobby closes at 10pm. I was turned away - not sure why they couldn't deliver my pizza outside to the parking lot.,5 years ago,Closed,1000806953
