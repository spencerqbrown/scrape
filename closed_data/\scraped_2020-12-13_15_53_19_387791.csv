Scott Blast,1.0,"I‚Äôm from originally from Chicago, and have enjoyed Rosati‚Äôs pizza many times, but the pizza from this location is absolutely horrible!  The sauce has no taste at all, and the crust was soggy.  If you‚Äôre thinking about ordering pizza from this place, I suggest you run the other way.
