Mike Mintz,4.0,Good food fair priced and quick service,2 years ago,Closed,2000348225
Ashlee Minyard,5.0,"My favorite thing to order here is a toasted Club sandwich with extra garlic butter on the bread, without the Italian dressing (ham, bacon, turkey, and mozzarella cheese) with Ranch dressing to dip it in. Their chicken, bacon, and ranch sandwiches are pretty good too, but the Club with Ranch is by far my favorite.",2 years ago,Closed,2000348225
Leo Lotspeich,5.0,"The pizza is always awesome and the calzones are too. It's a bit greasy at times, but honestly, that's how we prefer it. The parking is a little dismal, but they are rarely ever busy when we visit.",3 years ago,Closed,2000348225
