The hot dog pizza...the dogs are good, but the pizza is cardboard. Bummer. â€¦More",5 years ago,Closed,1000807983
Josh L,3.0,"Pizza is standard, some of the crust toppings are better than others, and you should bring your own utensils.",5 years ago,Closed,1000807983
Tim Turner,1.0,"My pizza was delivered with missing toppings.  When I called about it, the manager was rude and only offered a small credit ($5) off my next order.  I can accept the forgotten toppings, but because the poor customer service I received from the management I will not return to this location.",6 years ago,Closed,1000807983
