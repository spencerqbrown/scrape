Justin Heubrock,3.0,Could improve on cleaning.  Pizza came out fresh for the buffet. I liked the selection but it would have been an issue if I had kids with me.,2 years ago,Closed,1000820797
Natalie,3.0,"Expensive! But I loved the food! I ordered a meat lover pizza, pasta, boneless wings and 4 drinks for delivery.... $50! On a different day I ordered 2 medium 1 topping pizzas, 2 orders of wings, pasta, garlic knots....$30! Twice the food for almost half the price! Lesson learned! Order off the $5 menu!",a year ago,Closed,1000820797
Heidi Fenenga,3.0,"The food tasted good, but the service needs improvement. We ordered bread sticks and two pizzas. We never got the bread sticks, even after we reminded the waitress when she brought the pizzas. They tried to charge us for them, I told them ‚Ä¶More",2 years ago,Closed,1000820797
Kristen A,1.0,I also a month ago had a similar thing happen. I tried ordering a pizza there. 40 minutes later the lady called me back saying she didn‚Äôt know where the delivery driver is. She asked me to come get the pizza but I had no means of transportation. After reading other comments I feel like Jesus was looking out for me that day.,a year ago,Closed,1000820797

The pizza was actually pretty good, but the restaurant was really dirty and it was AWFUL customer service - the employees were seriously so horrible that it was borderline amusing.
