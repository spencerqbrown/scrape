Maryanna Woodside,4.0,"Overall, we had a great dining experience.  Service was quick and friendly.  Pizza was hot and good.  I wish they had mixed all the toppings all over the pizza instead of just putting one topping per three pieces, not a fan of that.  Our crust was burnt on the bottom as well.  Atmosphere was amazing, however.",a year ago,Closed,2000463240

Rich Dewey,1.0,I'm sorry but I've gone here a few times and hoped that next time would be better. But this time was probably the worst. Stood there for almost 10 mins while some kid counts his drawer and another one paces back and forth in the front. No ‚Ä¶More,a year ago,Closed,2000463240

Jon Hammett,5.0,"Great, friendly staff and an excellent deal for lunch or dinner. Is it the best pizza in the world?
