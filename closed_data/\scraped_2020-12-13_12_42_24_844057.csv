Debra Waters,5.0,"This Pizza Hut is the best! The people are great. They are nice, funny, and hard working. This location has never gotten my order wrong, it's always ready before the estimated time, and the customer service is the best!

Adam T,1.0,"Wish I could give it 0 stars. They said they couldn't deliver to my house because it's not in their area. I live ten minutes away! They have some half-witted excuse about their computer not pulling up certain locations, as if their delivery boys don't have GPS.
