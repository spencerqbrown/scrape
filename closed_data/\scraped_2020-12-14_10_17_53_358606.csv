James Goodnight,1.0,"Waited about an hour and 15 minutes on my delivery order that was estimated at 30 minutes. Store was out of boneless wings so I ended up with traditional, neither crust had flavoring on it that I ordered, one pizza was completely missing a topping (but still got charged for it), and the wrong sauce was on the wings. Very unimpressed.",4 years ago,Closed,1000810575
