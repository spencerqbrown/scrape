Jyve Turkey,5.0,"Clean and quiet, I went when they had a promo for free pizza. I really enjoyed it, you have to cook it yourself but it's as easy as tossing in the oven.",a year ago,Closed,2000225001
Monica K,5.0,"They have good pizza here. The staff have always been friendly and quick. Never had any issues here, but I would not recommend ordering any crust with extra butter. This plaza has lots of stores crammed into this area, so parking nearby can be a challenge sometimes.",3 years ago,Closed,2000225001

Karl Rickard,5.0,"Just had Papa Murphy's for the first time today.  Ordered 4 large pies, including their vegetarian, stuffed Chicago Style, Mediterranean Chicken, and a plain cheese.  They were ready in minutes, and looked great.  I had my doubts about how they would turn out in my own oven, but they cooked to perfection.  Will be going back!",7 years ago,Closed,2000225001
