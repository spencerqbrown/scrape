Candace Strickland,2.0,"It's now Pirate Pizza and my food was not great. There was nothing on the salad bar except for lettuce, onions, and cheese. Messed up my pizza bcuz they were out of ingredients. They did refund my entire order so hopefully next time I give it a try it will be better.",2 years ago,Closed,2000051002
