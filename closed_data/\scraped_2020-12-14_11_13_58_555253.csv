Kevin Wagers,1.0,"Great pizza. Terrible person working the counter. We called in the order 15 minutes before we arrive. They had not even started our order. There was no one in front of us either. On the phone the lady was rude, and when I paid for our pizza she was rude. The lady cooking in the back was nice and apologized.",4 months ago,Open,2000610686

Bob Brush,1.0,I really like Godfather's pizza and would have liked to order one if they would have ever picked up the phone. Tried calling multiple times...I guess they don't need the business because I'm not the only one with this problem. I'll just go elsewhere and order from their competition.,9 months ago,Open,2000610686
