Jamie Larkin,1.0,"They do not refrigerate after making, so you will pick up a floppy mess. The thin crust is so thin it is difficult to move to another pan (or even remove from the cardboard it comes on). Pretty much just brought home to through away. Very frustrating.",2 years ago,Closed,2000423742

Andrew Bush,5.0,"Shift Leader Teri deserves a raise. Not only did she make a great pizza, I saw her handle an entitled housewife like a champ.
