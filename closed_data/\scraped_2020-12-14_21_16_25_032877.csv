Leprechaun Dragon,5.0,"For the price, how can you complain? Also this location for some reason always tastes better than other locations. Maybe because they make it fresh more often... Try a stuffed crust extra most bestest. Damn good pie for a cheap fat guy!",2 years ago,Closed,2000027473
Bruce Chamberlin,5.0,"My friend give me a hard time about eating here until they give their pizza a try. You can either grab a quick pepperoni and go, or you can get the Supreme, ( which you'll have to wait about 7mins) and the Supreme is loaded!!  No olives, which for me and the wife, is awesome. (We dislike olives!)  Delicious!",a year ago,Closed,2000027473
Sean Zhang,2.0,"Ordered a pizaa today. Got in the store 25 minutes later to pick up. Waited in the store for another 25 minutes to finally got it. Obviously people ordered after me got their pizza ahead of me. Thankfully I asked once, otherwise I am not sure how long I'd have to wait.

P Harris,5.0,"Stopped in to try the Bacon crust pizza, WOW,  Got it freshly made with extra cheese, I have to say it was one of the best pizzas I've gotten in Denver.
