charlie dreyer,4.0,They were having some issues with their system and they were very courteous while I scrounged up the cash instead. Also I asked them to draw a cow on the box and they absolutely did. So far this is the only time someone has done that for me.,3 years ago,Closed,1000811471
EB,5.0,"These servers are champions of customer service. I need my pizza sometimes, you know how it gets?? SO I've been to Italy and this is the best pizza service I've ever gotten. ALL servers greet you with a smile and upon delivery they've always got a nice adage like ""when it rains it pours."" In this day and age that stands OUT",4 years ago,Closed,1000811471

D.J. DOUBLE J,4.0,"Had pretty quick service and the employees seemed to be friendly at this Pizza Hut in Queen Anne.

Riley Ritter,1.0,"I haven't been to this Pizza Hut in a really long time. I thought it was odd the small pizza only costed 7 but it should be advertised that the thing is only 6"" wide. Poorly made poorly cut pizza with the sauce from the last guys pizza spilled on your crust. Unappetizing. You get what you pay for.",4 years ago,Closed,1000811471
Gerald Cook,1.0,"Terrible service and don't be fooled that the name Pizza Hut is on the building, because damned if they are participating in any special you've seen advertised. $10 any size any topping from TV ads? Not here. $10 family dinner box advertised on TV and their own website? Not here.",7 years ago,Closed,1000811471
