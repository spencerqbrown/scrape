Rita Lamar,2.0,"I've always had a pretty good experience with them, but here lately they've not had enough drivers and just randomly shut down.

Victoria Gibson,1.0,I used to love this location. They used to be very prompt and had great customer service. But now? They barely ever have a delivery driver and they donâ€™t tell you that until youâ€™ve already been waiting for your food for 30 mins or more.
