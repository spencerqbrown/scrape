Jesse Blum,5.0,"It's so good I will give it 5 stars. The last two times I got regular crust instead of thin crust which I never order nor did I want regular crust. They still get 5 stars from me though bc everyone is always friendly there. They are always fresh, and honestly the best deal us with just a medium pizza you get a free rental so score haha.",a year ago,Closed,2000611788
