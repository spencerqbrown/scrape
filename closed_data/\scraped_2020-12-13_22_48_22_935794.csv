Ryan Jancik,4.0,"We visited the lunch buffet and have been coming to this location for the lunch buffet for years.  Service is always very good.  The pizzas were okay, but the quality seems to be decreasing over time.  It seems that the quality and taste of the pizzas was much better a few years ago.  Even the pan pizza crust wasn't as thick or as tasty.",4 years ago,Closed,1000812097
