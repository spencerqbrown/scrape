Ro Li,5.0,"Wow I think I just had my best airport breakfast ever here. Sandwich was made to order and it came out hot, fresh and tasty. The egg in my sandwich was cracked and cooked in front of my eyes. It was Friday 6:30 am but it only took them 5 …More",3 years ago,Open,2000182572

James Bisson,4.0,Good quick lunch.  Airport prices.  Friendly service with clean tables.  Never enough seating when you want it but it’s like that everywhere.   The Stromboli was packed with meat and cheese and the Greek salad fresh and delicious.  Located top of the escalator entering A terminal.,a year ago,Open,2000182572
Sidra Mahmood,1.0,"Bought this pizza and two more slices for my husband since the pizza looked good but unfortunately, it might be artificial food coloring to give the illusion of a fresh pizza. Yuck! The dough is so chewy and it tastes stale. Perhaps the …More",3 years ago,Open,2000182572
Alex Goulet,1.0,"Pizza was cold, not very tasty, and absurdly expensive (>$12 for two slices). Additionally, they do not accept personal cups to serve fountain drinks. The cashier was very dismissive of my concern for the vast amounts of toxic plastic waste …More",a year ago,Open,2000182572

Nicholas Martin,1.0,"Wish I'd looked at the reviews ahead of time. They advertise ""specials"" on the board but don't actually have medium drinks so they charge more for the Large.  The guy literally said the board is different from what they actually do.  I'm guessing the franchise wouldn't agree with their practices.",a year ago,Open,2000182572
Rich Ingleby,1.0,"Super good customer service... Worker refused to add pepperoni to a slice of cheese because, “he was too busy” and “they don’t give him another worker.” Funny because he spent more time arguing with me about not being able to do it than …More",a year ago,Open,2000182572
Mike .SA,2.0,"Below average customer service, greasy not fresh pizza. Over priced and wants over $1 for a refill in a small drink. $10.99 for 2 fancy pizza slices but because I didn’t want two slices of just cheese or just pepperoni I had to pay extra for what I didn’t even get.",2 years ago,Open,2000182572
Rob Sharpstein,2.0,I was about to order and saw the server or pizza man bring out one tray of dough and a stack of pre-made crusts in a plastic bag. Come to find out that only the cheese and pepperoni pizzas are stretched as made. The others are pre-made …More,a year ago,Open,2000182572
Thomas P,1.0,"Manager is not friendly, the food is overpriced, even for a restaurant in an airport, and it cost $1.59 to refill your drink that they already fill with ice to the top.

Geoff Fitch,5.0,"This location is inside terminal A of Logan airport. The slice of mushroom pizza was fresh, and pretty good, but a little on the bland side. No Pepsi or diet Pepsi, so I got a no-charge cup of water - which means I got an 8-ounce cup with 5 …More",a year ago,Open,2000182572
Christian Giles,2.0,"Might be acceptable pizza if you are hung over. Even then, a punch in the mouth is probably a better option. Choices are slim at the airport though so if you choose this pizza, pack some Dude Wipes for the plane.",2 years ago,Open,2000182572
Austin T,1.0,The attitude of the lady serving the food was the worst I have ever seen at a restaurant. She seemed very unhappy that you were there getting food. The Caesar salad was some iceberg lettuce and a few croutons.,a year ago,Open,2000182572
Coach K,5.0,"I was pleased with what I received. I will say that the pizza is waaay overpriced, however the slices I had we're rather delicious, I must say.
