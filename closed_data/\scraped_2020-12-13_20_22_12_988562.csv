Aaron O'Neal,5.0,"Excellent food coupled with friendly, prompt service and great prices.  The little oven they put your pizza through before they give it to you makes the crust taste phenomenal.  Best pizza in town.  I’m a big fan of buying fresh pizza by the slice too, for when you don’t need a whole pizza.",2 years ago,Closed,2000669715
