Harvey Mellard,5.0,The wait is never too long for a fresh pizza. Have been there twice and the staff has always been friendly and courteous. I watched as my pizza was assembled and packed up. Went home and enjoyed a delicious Pizza both times. Never crowded or a wait either time I visited. I definitely plan on being back,3 years ago,Closed,2000670761
