robbie rodgers,1.0,The vegetables on salad bar were brown. My plate and fork had dried food on them. Salad bar had no bacon bits and horrible selection. Staff acted like they had a third grade education. Very displeaded!! Also the pizza was totally dry. I would give 0 stars but that's not an option.,4 years ago,Closed,1000814836
Lindsay Walton,1.0,Ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and it took almost 1.5 hours to receive it. Called about 45 minutes after ordering and was told that it should be delivered momentarily. This happens every time we order pizza from the Pizza a hit here in Hernando.,5 years ago,Closed,1000814836

Patrick Swindoll,1.0,Maybe the worst Pizza Hut in America.  Understaffed and nasty on the inside.  Ordered a pizza online that would be ready in 30 minutes and when I got there they had not even put it in the oven with ONE person working the restaurant and one other making deliveries.,5 years ago,Closed,1000814836
