Austin Dantzler,5.0,"If you have not tried it already, I have to give a reccomendation for the Papa Murphy's pizza next to Publix.  The thin crust is really good, but it is the stuffed pizza that is absolutely amazing!",2 years ago,Closed,2000633020

Nikki Thompson,5.0,I know many people are used to take out that is hot at the door but I like the fact I can control whether my pizza is baked when and how I want it.  The staff is pleasant every time which is a plus always sure to greet me as soon as I enter.  Nice place and great food.  Worth trying it.,2 years ago,Closed,2000633020
Kris Klenke,5.0,Best Pizza Ever!!!! I‚Äôve been cooking these pizza‚Äôs in Wisconsin since the late 90s and was glad to see them finally migrate south. You get so much more value then other pizza places and taste way better. I‚Äôd recommend the 5-meats stuffed pizza or if you don‚Äôt need that much the Chicken Garlic is great too.,2 years ago,Closed,2000633020

Matt Harrell,2.0,"Bought 2 pizzas after hearing a few folks rave about these pizzas for sometime.  Maybe my expectations were set too high.  My family and I found the pizza to be bland.
