Matthew Richards,4.0,"For being attached to a gas station, I'm surprised that I can't bring myself to rate it any lower than 4-Stars. The food is good, the portions are more than generous, and the lunch buffet is a guilty pleasure. The seating are consists hard plastic benches and tables, and isn't cleaned often enough, if at all during the day.",2 years ago,Closed,1000874825
