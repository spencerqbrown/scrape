Jacquelyn Bokker,5.0,"Walked in five minutes before closing expecting them to tell me they'd already closed the kitchen. Amelia, the manager, was more than happy to spend time to make me a pizza and wings. Great customer service and friendly staff.",3 years ago,Closed,1000817050
Mike Hollender,2.0,This place is cheap on its toppings! I've ordered and paid for extra and it's still barely any toppings. Cheap owners running things cheaply and it will eventually cost them all their customers.,2 years ago,Closed,1000817050
Alexis DeHart,1.0,I had to repeat my adress like 5 times so they can get to my house. They are in Agoura and I am in Westlake and they said it would take 45-60 minutes. Very bad service for me,a year ago,Closed,1000817050
