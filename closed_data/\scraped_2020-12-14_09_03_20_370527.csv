Delivery King,1.0,This Papa John's is a let down in every aspect imaginable. The people are right when they say the staff just doesn't care. Delivery drivers can be seen outside the store front smoking away. Not even Shaq can help save this store. It's a ‚Ä¶More,a year ago,Closed,2000632982

Lindsay Scott,1.0,"Easily the worst local option for pizza. They‚Äôre rude, don‚Äôt answer the phone and if they do it‚Äôs to put you on hold. Order is 30 mins late with no apology or explanation. They clearly don‚Äôt need the business.",a year ago,Closed,2000632982

Kyle Sershon,1.0,Terrible customer service. Manager could care less about my concerns and felt it was better to interrupt then actually listen. Told me right from the start it basically wasn't his problem. Last time I'm ordering from here.,2 years ago,Closed,2000632982

Dennis Yu,1.0,Unprofessional area supervisor Ms. Misty Holden when setting an appointment at least remind TO CALL if there are changes not just no CALL NO show. I travel 20 mins and NO SHOW!

The Death Midwife,1.0,"If I could give this place a negative rating of 200 stars, I would. Their casual flippancy and shoulder shrug response to spectacularly screwing up was epic. I ordered over $100.00 worth of pizza for a moving crew of big guys.  Over an ‚Ä¶More",3 years ago,Closed,2000632982

Jesus Valle,1.0,"Everything is always undercooked. I had to put my chicken wings in the oven because they were so raw. The sausage taste like breakfast link sausages, it's utterly disgusting.
