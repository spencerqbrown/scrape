Katie Laughlin,5.0,"Their personal pizzas are my favorite. Also their buffet from 11am-2pm on Monday-Saturday is wonderful. All you can eat pizza, salad and soda for about $8.00 I always leave a $2.00 tip. So 10 bucks for about 5 slices and 2 servings of salad and a refill of soda. Staff is great too.
