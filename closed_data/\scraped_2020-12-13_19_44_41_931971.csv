NK S,5.0,"I order from them often as I work nights in the area. I've only had a mistake on my order once and they immediately comped my meal. Not sure what all the bad reviews are for, they have always been a good Pizza Hut. Better than the one in Southfield.",4 years ago,Closed,2000463941

Gregory Oden,1.0,"Staff was friendly. This location doesn't include the lover's pizza in the any large pizza for 10.00. Pizza was very greasy and the Italian sausage had a funky taste to it, bacon was undone and had a bad after taste. This  location gets two thumbs down.",3 years ago,Closed,2000463941
