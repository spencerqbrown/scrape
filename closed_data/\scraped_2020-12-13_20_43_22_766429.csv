Dan Kobs,5.0,"Ordered online with two hours notice, they were a bit late. Called to follow up, they were amazingly apologetic, fixed the issue before I even had a chance to complain. Quality was excellent as usual. Only good things to say about Thier customer service. Could have been terrible, instead I'm going out of my way to compliment them.",4 years ago,Closed,1000812458
