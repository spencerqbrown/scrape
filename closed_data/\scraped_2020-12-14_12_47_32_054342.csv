Penny Ziv,1.0,"This place isn't even open. For good reason too. They were horrible. They brought the pizza hut name down. Constant turnover of employees and managers. Bad service. Messed up orders. So bad, I refused to go back or order from there more than a year before they closed. If I could they'd get zero stars",3 years ago,Closed,1000808993

LaVina Cordelia,1.0,"Alas, this Pizza Hut is no more.   Rumor has it that corporate offices effectively squeezed them out of business by demanding expensive renovations that this site could not justify by the amount of customers they received.  Quite a shame.",3 years ago,Closed,1000808993
