Amy Zill,2.0,Garlic crust was very flavorful. Though it was a bit flimsy and thin for a hand tossed pizza. Ordered delivery. Ordered 2 blue cheese dip cups. Got 2 ranch cups. I hate ranch! I drove to pizza hut to get my blue cheese cups. I rarely order delivery for this reason. Thought I'd give it another chance.,a year ago,Closed,1000806121
Kevin Shockney,1.0,"This place needs a interior/exterior facelift for starters because it looks like it's straight out of the early 90's. Also, it seems like no matter how slow it is inside, it takes entirely too long to get our food. Once the food arrives then it's good as usual. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Never visiting again.",2 years ago,Closed,1000806121

Ryan Morgan,1.0,The waiter spilled drinks over other customers  and they didn't give us silverware so I couldn't eat my salad and they also told us to wait until the pizza came out to get silverware. I don't recommend this pizza hut. It sucked.,2 years ago,Closed,1000806121
Kelly Marion,2.0,It was good but disappointing because they said on the supermo sandwich they took the salmie off the sandwich but jason had salmie an put it on my sandwich.
