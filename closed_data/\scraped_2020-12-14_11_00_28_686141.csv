KP Kilpatrick,5.0,The only bad thing is that DoorDash delivered my order 20+ minutes late and I had to reheat the whole pie in the oven.  Next time I will do the smart thing and pick it up myself.,2 months ago,Open,1000894365
John Herceg,5.0,Far and away the absolute best pizza i have had since leaving new york in 1985. Not up for all of the carbs? Large greek salad with gyro meat.
