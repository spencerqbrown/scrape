Amber Walker,3.0,They close at one time then another and always stop taking orders 15 minutes before they close! So they don't reflect that anywhere in their signage. Makes it hard to give higher rating. The employees are always genuinely friendly and polite.,2 years ago,Closed,1000863873

REZIVOR since93,5.0,"A great Little Caesars location. I am REALLY hoping that the Little Caesars in Kmart can remain open when U-Haul moves to the Kmart building.

Meagan Hoffert,2.0,"I‚Äôm not expecting a lot considering the pizza is cheap, but my husband and I have been to a few Little Caesar‚Äôs in our time.

Donald Iarussi MFA,5.0,I think their Pizza is way better than 90% of the place is that advertised on television or advertise to the hipsters that they have great pizza when actually they don't it's sad when you can actually say that a $5 Pizza is better than 90% of the pizza places in town,a year ago,Closed,1000863873
