Jun J,5.0,Delicious vegan pizza and salad! We got the Berkeley Vegan and a California salad with balsamic. The customer service was great throughout the day as we had to coordinate the delivery around unseasonal snow flurries. I never thought I'd see the day where I could get a dank af vegan pizza delivered to my door. Thanks y'all!,a year ago,Closed,2000632561

Maytal Abramson,3.0,"Might be a good place to bring a group of kids, but if you want good pizza, there are better options in Reno. Pizza is okay, the crust is good but the service can be a bit slow. I would not recommend the salads or the vegan pizza. For vegans, just order no cheese!",3 years ago,Closed,2000632561
