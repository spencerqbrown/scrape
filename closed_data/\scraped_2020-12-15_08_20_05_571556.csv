Hillary Owens,1.0,This particular store is making a terrible name for Pizza Hut. We placed an order at 3:00pm and they said it would take about 45 mins. We waited around until 4:15 and decided to call back wondering where our pizza was. They said they …More,4 years ago,Closed,1000808344
David Allardyce,1.0,"Two and a half hour wait to get a cold hard pizza. One of the pizzas had sauce and cheese on one side.... but not the other. The answer I got from the stoner working there, on where my pizza was, was that the driver left 15 minutes. …More",4 years ago,Closed,1000808344
Herman Oxborrow,5.0,They have never burned or mishandled my food. They are prompt and reasonably polite. If I wanted a nice atmosphere and a view I wouldn't go to a place that focuses on delivery.,6 years ago,Closed,1000808344
Samantha B,1.0,I ordered one pizza to be well done to be delivered. It arrived and it was cold and just barely cooked and was 30 minutes later than the time I was told. I called and complained and they said either I can have a credit toward another pizza …More,7 years ago,Closed,1000808344
Cary,1.0,I have tried to order from here a few times but the delivery time is always too long. One time at 5pm it was a two hour wait and 1 hour and 15 minutes the last time I tried. That was at 7:45 pm - way past rush hour. No other pizza place in the city takes that long. It's like they have no drivers working there.,5 years ago,Closed,1000808344
Sabrina Jane,1.0,"I had my pizzas delivered while I was at work at a clients house. Not only did they NOT follow any of the special requests I asked (to call, not knock since they have a super reactive dog and I wanted my pizza extra crispy with the spinach …More",5 years ago,Closed,1000808344
Bumblebee Hill,1.0,THEY NEVER ANSWER THEIR PHONES! Good luck ever getting a pizza. What a joke. You'll be on hold for 30 min before they just hang up on you.,4 years ago,Closed,1000808344
Shelley Rossi,1.0,"Placed an order and when I got the email confirmation it showed the wrong items ordered. I called the number - which is their call center - and waited on hold for 5 minutes. By the time the woman got to me and then called over to the store, they had already made my order and said nothing could be changed. Don't order online. Call. :-(",4 years ago,Closed,1000808344
Jalil Rasul,1.0,"I wish I could give it No starts at all.

Garrett Landry,3.0,"They have good pizza and have a good value. They are delivery and carry out only. Parking can be pretty rough though. If you can afford delivery, do it.",8 years ago,Closed,1000808344
David Halpin,1.0,"They often get the order wrong and the delivery times are way off the estimates. Multiple calls to have a manager call me back and they never return the call. I complained to Pizza Hutt and hey said they are a franchise that they don't control. So, they can't do anything. I will be switching to Dominos for now on.",4 years ago,Closed,1000808344
Drew D,2.0,Very busy and online wait time lied. Had to wait 45 min total vs the countdown started at just 20. Lots of pizzas were sitting in the hot box for delivery the whole time... Pizza was spongey,6 years ago,Closed,1000808344

Matthew Chun,2.0,"Delivery time was sadly expected to take a little over one hour, yet it took over 2 hours to arrive.
