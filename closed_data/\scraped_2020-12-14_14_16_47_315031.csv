Tatum Lyles,2.0,"I gave them two stars because they put out lots of pizza on the buffet. I took three away because the sign says $4.99 for a buffet, with purchase of a drink in tiny print. The waiter didn't even mention that when we ordered waters. Got to the front to pay $10 and was charged almost $15 .That's sneaky and we won't be back.",2 years ago,Closed,1000810412
