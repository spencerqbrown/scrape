Justin Shumway,3.0,"The food is great! But the last 3 delivery orders had something missing, whether it was drinks, sauces or the wrong order! First time, okay mistakes happen, but 3 times in a row?",5 years ago,Closed,1000808207
Anthony Tomsic,1.0,"I waited 50 minutes for 1 large pizza. It was supposed to take 20 mins. I think even i can make a pizza in under 10 minutes. We ordered hand tossed pizza, we got pan made pizza. Me and my family don't really like cheese pizza so none of use ate it except 3 people. So you won't be seeing us any time in the future, Thanks for the wait.",4 years ago,Closed,1000808207
Chris Orellana,1.0,"Way too expensive, worst of all, wasn't even worth the money. Asked for 2 large pizzas and gave me what would be considered a small in Dominos. Over all, pizza tasted like deep fried cardboard. Would recommend dominos instead since their pizzas taste better, more is provided, and a LOT cheaper.",5 years ago,Closed,1000808207
