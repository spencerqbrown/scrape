Matthew McDaniel,5.0,"This is my favorite pizza delivery restaraunt! Their prices are great and they have all sorts of options to choose from! Anything from feeding 1 to hosting a party, they have it! They also have exceptional service that is fast and polite. Everyone I have spoken to has been kind and helpful.",2 years ago,Closed,2000001172

Daniel Gary,1.0,"It was expensive and not great for the price .The inside of the business reeked of smoke and was dirty.  I'm sure some of the Fox's pizza places are nice, but avoid this one.",2 years ago,Closed,2000001172

Joey Burdin,2.0,I've order from this place several time out of convenience but the pizza isn't very good and delivery takes a long time... if something is wrong they don't seem to want to make it right. Delivery drivers have always been friendly though.,3 years ago,Closed,2000001172

Whitney Aitkens,1.0,"This place is a joke. A kid is running the store, no adults around and they waited until we got there to pick up our order to decide to make it. After we had waited 45 minutes to come pick it up, and they made no effort to make it right.",3 years ago,Closed,2000001172
