Linda Berardini,4.0,Love the pizza! One of my favorites. Place could use some updates. Worse thing there is the wings. They have to be the smallest ones I have ever seen! Wish they had free refills on drinks.,2 years ago,Closed,1000879002
Bobby Smith,1.0,"The one we visit is in the Kmart in Pleasant Hills, PA. I like the pizza is good. I don't like the fact that they answer the phone at  6:36 PM with "" Little Caesar's  Pizza, were closed"" is upsetting.",2 years ago,Closed,1000879002
Harry Devine,2.0,Don't bother. This location is never open. It either closes too early or it closes earlier than scheduled with no warning. Either Kmart or Little Caesars or both don't care at all about keepig business at this location. Frustrating when you are hoping to quickly pick up a pizza.,2 years ago,Closed,1000879002
Melissa T,1.0,Why is no one doing anything about this time issue! I walked in at 6:40pm and was told they were closed as the guy from little Caesarswas walking out. I asked what time they closed he said 7pm. But was walking out at 6:40pm. Your time on here shows open until 8pm. This is not right.!!,2 years ago,Closed,1000879002

Ken Rebholz,1.0,I've been there 3 times inn the past 2 weeks to find that they closed early. They are supposed to be open till 8pm. It is 6:11pm. The past 2 times invent there were also around 6pm. Someone needs to either change the store hours or hire employees that will stay open. Very upsetting,2 years ago,Closed,1000879002
