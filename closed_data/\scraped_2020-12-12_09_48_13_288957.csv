David L Clarke,1.0,Went to two different pizza hut restaurants. Two different owners. They both had terrible service and a dirty restaurant. The one in Derry NH is now closed. I don't know about the other one. I haven't been to this one in Keene NH and don't intend to. All because of the reputation of the other two. Sorry,a year ago,Closed,1000814247
