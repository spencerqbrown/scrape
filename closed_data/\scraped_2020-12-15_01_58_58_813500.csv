Dong Jae Lee,4.0,"Delivery takes at least 35- 50 min which is pretty long compared to Papa John's and Domino's 20 min, but if it takes longer than usual, Pizza Hut will make up for it which is nice of them. Pizza is delicious and it is better than Papa ‚Ä¶More",2 years ago,Closed,2000015437

Nick Ni,1.0,"Just a truly awful location. You can order whatever you like, but don't expect pizza sauce on more half of your pizza, uneven topping distribution, and they have NEVER. been able to cut slices all the way through. This is by far the WORST franchise location I've ever experienced. Avoid at all costs, drive an extra 4 miles",2 years ago,Closed,2000015437

Vati 987,1.0,BAD. The worst pizza ever. I ordered Hawaiian pizza and after 15 minutes waiting I get a pizza with few pcs of Canadian bacon and pineapple.
