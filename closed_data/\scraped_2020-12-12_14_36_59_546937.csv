Lynden Douglas,3.0,the place is dreary and I seems like there are never any customers. The steak and cheese was good. But never never inform you of the specials. its when your seated there is a card n the table displaying the deal and you realize its too late cause you already have the food and could have gotten more had you known,2 years ago,Closed,1000824956
