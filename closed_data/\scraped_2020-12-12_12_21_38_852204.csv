Paul Tomkiel,4.0,"Pizza was prepared quickly and well.  The staff were pleasant to work with.  The price was less than Dominoes and Papa Johns, but tasted better.  Apparently this Fox's Pizza heard the reviews and improved.  Will probably buy pizza from here again.",5 years ago,Closed,1000857013
BeaBetterU Society,1.0,This place is absolutely terrible. Their employees is rude and doesn't take responsibility for her actions. It took Alexis 45 minutes to make a burnt taco pizza.  And than out want even cut when it came out. Worse experience at a pizza shop ever. I don't even know how they maintain their corporate structure.,3 years ago,Closed,1000857013
