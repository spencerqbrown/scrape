James Grapes,1.0,Made pizza incorrectly and was dismissive of my inconvenience. Place is ran by teens who are indifferent about producing a quality product in a friendly atmosphere. I do not recommend this location. Try the other one by North Central... that place is ran by more professional employees.,a year ago,Closed,2000407439
Brandon T,4.0,Definitely not gourmet pizza but i seem to find it more enjoyable than more expensive places. The location is also great. Nice spot within walking distance of a grocery store AND one of the best liqour stores in town. Great stop on a Friday …More,a year ago,Closed,2000407439

josh lang,1.0,It was ok pizza when it was $20. Went back 2 days later and not only did the pizza almost double in price 20-31$ but so did the wait time. I'll never go to another papa johns again.

nickel bee,3.0,3.33 for delivery fee?! It keeps going up... quality is  low usually. I almost feel like on certain  days they use old ingredients or give you old pizzas. Only about 1 out of 4 tries is it any good. Otherwise  it looks and smells kinda gross. Better than the other places here but that's  not saying much.,3 years ago,Closed,2000407439
