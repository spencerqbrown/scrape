Amanda Heasley,5.0,"I've been going to this Pizza Hut for years. They have rarely messed up an order, even when they are INCREDIBLY busy (which is the case quite often). The staff are very friendly and competent.",3 years ago,Closed,1000816454
Mark Goho,4.0,Solid choice for pizza in Gates. We order almost exclusively online and get some good discounts. Orders are always ready very quickly and staff is friendly and attentive. My only complaint would be the fact that they charge for little dipping sauces. Kind of ticks me off.,5 years ago,Closed,1000816454
