Dar Par,5.0,"Pizza hut has always been a great place to get a quick meal, but the last time I went there wow, it had new management(sorry to say they should have kept there old crew).

Kyle Harper,5.0,"This is an excellent Pizza Hut. The one where I live near St. Louis always skimps out on toppings. This place really dishes it out! I should have tried a sandwich since our restaurants don't offer this selection! Only complaint is this store doesn't offer the 10 dollar any pizza deal.
