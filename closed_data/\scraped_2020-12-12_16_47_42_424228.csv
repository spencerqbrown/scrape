sashank chennupalli,2.0,"Worst customer service ever. I called  to place an order for the pizza after getting an error message while placing the order on the website. The lady who took the order was not technical Savy and couldn't place the order. The general manager got on the phone and he was very rude. Go to pizza hut, this store sucks",7 years ago,Closed,2000025144
