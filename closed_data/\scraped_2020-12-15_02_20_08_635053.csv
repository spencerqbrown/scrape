Scott Cusack,5.0,"The stuffed pizzas are fantastic. My two boys live the 5 meat stuffed pizza. It is very good and surprisingly not greasy. I prefer the veggie stuffed pizza. If you haven't had one of these, it's a pizza within a pizza. The crust is great and it's very filling. You do have to bake it at home but it makes it taste that much more fresh.",2 years ago,Closed,2000633013
