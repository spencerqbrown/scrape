I show up 20 mins later the girl at the window said 2 more minutes, and had me park beside the carry out marked parking spot. Waited 15 more minutes. FINALLY SHOWS UP! Mind you the app said it was ready when I was at the window for pickup. Must be clocked on when pizza actually is done and they are lying about the ACTUAL finished time! 😡 The pizza however was FANTASTIC!",3 weeks ago
Kare bear,3.0,The bread sticks were great. They had the right amount of cheese. I ordered a large chicken bell pepper extra cheese pizza . I got no extra cheese and the dough is soo weird. Like the middle is like so thin all the toppings just fall off.  And it just tasted off. Like the dough was expired or something. The extr,10 months ago

Misty Gotte,1.0,"Our two, three topping pizzas only had 1 and 2 toppings and our cheese sticks were old and not even sliced. Very disappointed. We have eaten here a lot in the past but this time was by far the worst we’ve experienced.",4 months ago
Rebecca Justus,4.0,"This place is hard to review. Their turnover is crazy so you never know what you're going to get. Sometimes it's hot, fast, and your order is always right. Then for a couple months they can't get a single order right and wait times are out of control. But it's Pizza Hut, so even when the store isn't great the pizza is great and they accept the deals and coupons from the app which not all of them do so we'll keep going back.",9 months ago
Rhonda Prine,5.0,Fast great pastA,a week ago
Bill Odwyer,4.0,"The hand tossed pizza was very good.  The salad bar was well stocked and clean, everything was very fresh.  Nice friendly staff.  I would love to go back to this store in Ash Flats.  The only problem was the bath room.  No soap to wash your hands, so you know the employees can't wash theirs.  I had a handicapped person with me and he could not get at the toilet paper, it was so low, the toilet paper dispenser.",10 months ago

Sara Patch,2.0,"Although the Food is Great, the service is not. Takes forever to get your food, the refills on the drinks are self serve for the most part. ( better off getting up and getting it yourself or getting carry out ) The crew that is suppose to bust the tables, takes forever to do it and most of the tables stay dirty.  When the staff do talk to you they are friendly through.",a year ago

However sometimes the tomatoes are rotten at the salad bar.",10 months ago
Lynn Mitchell,1.0,"Waitresses are very insulting to customers then they deliver food to everyone else including the buffet and over an hour later they deliver the pizza that was ordered before everyone else ordered.  Then when customer orders a Dr. Pepper and the waitress decides that the customer needs a Diet Dr. Pepper and tells them that they can only bring them a Diet Dr. Pepper but brings their friend a regular Dr. Pepper.   
Guess these waitresses don't understand that they depend on TIPS to help supplement their income and insulting customers and letting their pizza sit on the counter for over 20 minutes isn't part of receiving a tip.",9 months ago

Yeet yeet Dawg 11,1.0,"We have been very disappointed the past 3 times we have ate at the ash flat store. John, the waiter, has always been amazing to us and always got our order correct. We haven’t got a correct order since the last time we saw him. We always tip John very well, $10-15, but do not get the same service when he isn’t there. I still tip but do not consider it a good investment due to the lack of good service. We will be trying the store in Batesville to see if the longer drive will be worth the service there. Definitely two thumbs down 👎 👎",a year ago

Doug Milner,5.0,"Good pizza & good pizza buffet. My only complaint  for the buffet is that sufficient  pizzas  should be made prior to opening the door at 11 am . In addition,  upon sending pizza out to the buffet, more pizza should be made to get in the oven. Once the pizza is sent out, there is a mad dash to get some & then a huge lag time with none until the next pizzas  are ready to come out!!!  Lick it in gear!!!!!!",3 years ago

Joel Goss,1.0,"So, after not being able to place an order for over an hour and half of calling (due to the line being constantly and unendingly busy) I placed my order online. It was delivered after my delivery guy lost and then found my childrens large half pepperoni half cheese pizza in his car, I opened it to find it wasn't half cheese half pepperoni.  A lot of the toppings had slid off the pizza and onto the side of the box, making it half pepperoni half no toppings.  If this was my first poor experience from this location I would chalk it up to win some lose some reality, however this type of outcome when ordering food from this location is regular.  It bums me out, there is only really one pizza location in the area and this is it.  Order @ your own risk, we do, and now I will be having to ask every driver to open the pizza box and show me what I am paying for before taking it into my home.  Common sense dictates I should have done that before signing the receipt, but lesson learned.",3 years ago

Food came out reasonably quickly then we didnt see our server for another 10 minutes.  Brought refills and then disappeared. We ended up asking another server for a box and then that same server for our bill because we never saw our server again.  I left before the bill was brought so I cant say how that went.

We were half way done with are pizzas when she finally brought the spaghetti out she said it just came out ,we'll it couldn't of it was ice cold. Then we asked her for a box for the pizza and spaghetti she gave us 2 Pizza BOXES . REALLY. Then we couldn't get her to come back to are table finally got the other waitress attention and asked her to tell our waitress we wanted to see her.we waited another 20 minutes,so my husband went up to see if he could get something to put the spaghetti in. Couldn't get anyone to help him, so he went to the take out counter to get something they didn't really want to help him either but they did. I don't know what they were doing but they needed to get there ass out of the kitchen and take care of the customers. It was just horrible service and food. I will never recommend that place to anyone.",3 years ago
Dave G,5.0,"We Ordered from this Pizza Hut all year for my son and other students that attends school in Howe, In. We ordered dozens of pizzas there almost every week.  Naturally,  they have made a couple human errors. But, they gave Always made good with their end of the bargain. So, over the course of the whole year the pizzas were made Right 99% of the time. If not they made it right with our family and students.  The managers and staff are very friendly and helpful.  Delivery drivers polite and on time as well. Not bad for delivering hundreds of pizzas this year to the school.

We were going to have a salad, but after looking at the disgusting appearance of the salad bar, we changed our minds.  We told the waitress we couldn't chew the crust.

Pizza huts food was pretty good, we got plenty of marinara sauce which is something I feel is always over looked.

My roommate and I went for dinner on Black Friday - I worked that morning, and we decided to try this place before we went shopping. 

We had an amazing time. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I ordered a Sprite with a cherry shot, which was nice and sweet, but the Sprite had ran out of syrup. When I asked for another, she immediately went to check, fixed the syrup herself, and waited for me to try my replacement to see if I liked it or wanted something else.

We also tried the new garlic knot crust, which our waitress admitted was the first one ordered here. The garlic knots had to be made by hand first and then placed on the crust, and the staff asked for our feedback on where they were placed and how it tasted. It was very good! We do plan to go back and get this again.

We also got the cinnabon rolls and bread sticks, so we knew we would need boxes for everything. Our waitress helped us box everything, chatted with us while she did, and rang us up shortly after, even when more customers started coming in and she had to wait on them.

I'm writing this review in February of a dinner I had in late November because it was just that good.",7 months ago

P. A.,1.0,"Atrocious service.  When I walked in, I was the only customer.  Although there were at least 4 people standing there talking, no one made an effort to wait on me.  Another woman came from the back and did so.  She was very nice, but seemed unsure of herself.  Once my order was placed, she told me she'd call my name when it was ready.  So, I took a seat at the entrance and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Nearly 30 minutes later I went to the counter to see where my food was.  There was no one in sight.  Even when I called out, no one appeared.  After a few minutes, a young man with a jacket on walked in.  He was, clearly, a delivery driver.  I asked him about my order.  He stepped over to the holding oven, stared at it and did nothing else.  When the woman who waited on me returned, he walked away mumbling she could help.  I needed to show my receipt to prove I had an order.  When she walked back to the kitchen area, she came out and stated my order had just come out.  Please!  This place had only one other order after mine!  With such abysmal service, I've no idea how they stay in business.  Someone MUST actively and properly manage the place.  To top it all off, the bone-outs weren't completely sauced.  It is their job to get it right.  Nice enough people, but terrible service!",a year ago-

Jason Martin,1.0,"Below was a previous post but today my opinion changed.  We ordered pizza for take you child to work day and not only did they not fill the order....they told us we couldn't order again.  Things get messed up, I understand. But for a general manager to be the jerk he was and refuse to even make pizzas if we reorder is ridiculous. My opinion has completely changed. I don't know if there was a change of management but there should be after today. 

We have always had good service year. If they say that your order is going to be ready at a specific time you will never need to wait. They are always very good about asking if you need any type of plates or silverware. At one point we had bought a bunch of pizza for a birthday party at a local hotel and that one question was a life saver",a year ago
Robert Darnell,1.0,Employees and manager were rude.  If I were the owner I’d be looking for new management.  Had a large order but they said the card didn’t work.   Called back with another card but they said the they cancelled the order and said they wouldn’t serve use because “we kept bugging them and called back over and over” we made 2 phone calls.  told them to kick rocks... called dominos and had pizza within 20 min...  original card worked fine.

Sharon L.,5.0,"Was able to order online and because of that, received the 50% off special.  I love how I can customize my pizza.  I was able to pick my thickness of the crust, flavored crust, light sauce, and variety of toppings.  When I got to the store to pick up the pizza, there is a screen which let's you know how much longer till your pizza is done.  I also signed up for Pizza Hut rewards so I can get rewarded for using Pizza Hut.  I highly recommend this Pizza Hut location. I had a very pleasant experience and will be ordering again.",a year ago-

Nick Hagman,4.0,"Not sure why this is called Pizza Hut. 

Delivery was fast, customer service nice, but just like every review here, there is something off with the pizza. Don't get me wrong, it actually tastes good! But it doesn't taste Pizza Hut good. The personal pan pizza was very thin, cheese wasn't stringy, looks overcooked, the toppings look like they were just thrown on as an afterthought...

And yet I give 4 stars. Because it tastes good. I'm confused, because it doesn't look like the pizza would taste good, and yet it does! It just comes to show that looks isn't everything. For instance, the Pizza Hut in Westminster LOOKS like it would taste good, but I've never had worse pizza in my life.

To sum up: is the food good? Yes. Is it Pizza Hut good? No. Would I still recommend it? Yes. Have I had worse pizza before? Yes.
