Mind you the app said it was ready when I was at the window for pickup.

The wings were good but the pizza was just plain bad. 2 medium pizzas had a total of 6 pepperoni, combined, and almost no cheese. They were basically 2 medium loves of bread. No flavor and ice cold.

Joel Goss,1.0,"So, after not being able to place an order for over an hour and half of calling (due to the line being constantly and unendingly busy) I placed my order online. It was delivered after my delivery guy lost and then found my childrens large half pepperoni half cheese pizza in his car, I opened it to find it wasn't half cheese half pepperoni.  A lot of the toppings had slid off the pizza and onto the side of the box, making it half pepperoni half no toppings.  If this was my first poor experience from this location I would chalk it up to win some lose some reality, however this type of outcome when ordering food from this location is regular.  It bums me out, there is only really one pizza location in the area and this is it.  Order @ your own risk, we do, and now I will be having to ask every driver to open the pizza box and show me what I am paying for before taking it into my home.  Common sense dictates I should have done that before signing the receipt, but lesson learned.",3 years ago-,1000804753.0

Pizza huts food was pretty good, we got plenty of marinara sauce which is something I feel is always over looked.

Adrian Cooper,5.0,"This pizza hut stands out in my mind as the one with the kindest and most thorough customer service i've experienced with the franchise. 

My roommate and I went for dinner on Black Friday - I worked that morning, and we decided to try this place before we went shopping. 

We had an amazing time. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I ordered a Sprite with a cherry shot, which was nice and sweet, but the Sprite had ran out of syrup. When I asked for another, she immediately went to check, fixed the syrup herself, and waited for me to try my replacement to see if I liked it or wanted something else.

We also tried the new garlic knot crust, which our waitress admitted was the first one ordered here. The garlic knots had to be made by hand first and then placed on the crust, and the staff asked for our feedback on where they were placed and how it tasted. It was very good! We do plan to go back and get this again.

We also got the cinnabon rolls and bread sticks, so we knew we would need boxes for everything. Our waitress helped us box everything, chatted with us while she did, and rang us up shortly after, even when more customers started coming in and she had to wait on them.

I'm writing this review in February of a dinner I had in late November because it was just that good.",7 months ago,1000804756.0

P. A.,1.0,"Atrocious service.  When I walked in, I was the only customer.  Although there were at least 4 people standing there talking, no one made an effort to wait on me.  Another woman came from the back and did so.  She was very nice, but seemed unsure of herself.  Once my order was placed, she told me she'd call my name when it was ready.  So, I took a seat at the entrance and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Nearly 30 minutes later I went to the counter to see where my food was.  There was no one in sight.  Even when I called out, no one appeared.  After a few minutes, a young man with a jacket on walked in.  He was, clearly, a delivery driver.  I asked him about my order.  He stepped over to the holding oven, stared at it and did nothing else.  When the woman who waited on me returned, he walked away mumbling she could help.  I needed to show my receipt to prove I had an order.  When she walked back to the kitchen area, she came out and stated my order had just come out.  Please!  This place had only one other order after mine!  With such abysmal service, I've no idea how they stay in business.  Someone MUST actively and properly manage the place.  To top it all off, the bone-outs weren't completely sauced.  It is their job to get it right.  Nice enough people, but terrible service!",a year ago-,1000804756.0

We ordered pizza for take you child to work day and not only did they not fill the order....they told us we couldn't order again.  Things get messed up, I understand. But for a general manager to be the jerk he was and refuse to even make pizzas if we reorder is ridiculous. My opinion has completely changed. I don't know if there was a change of management but there should be after today. 

We have always had good service year. If they say that your order is going to be ready at a specific time you will never need to wait. They are always very good about asking if you need any type of plates or silverware.

Delivery was fast, customer service nice, but just like every review here, there is something off with the pizza. Don't get me wrong, it actually tastes good! But it doesn't taste Pizza Hut good. The personal pan pizza was very thin, cheese wasn't stringy, looks overcooked, the toppings look like they were just thrown on as an afterthought...

And yet I give 4 stars. Because it tastes good. I'm confused, because it doesn't look like the pizza would taste good, and yet it does! It just comes to show that looks isn't everything. For instance, the Pizza Hut in Westminster LOOKS like it would taste good, but I've never had worse pizza in my life.

To sum up: is the food good? Yes. Is it Pizza Hut good? No. Would I still recommend it? Yes. Have I had worse pizza before? Yes.

christopher rodriguez,1.0,I just want to start of by saying that usually they are pretty good at delivering my food but today was the exception. I called and placed an order but my food never arrived. I waited for an hour before calling the store and asking for an update and I was told it would be 10 minutes so I waited for another hour and a half before calling the location  to cancel my order. I waited for 2.5 hours before canceling my order. Total disappointment with today's experience. Hopefully next time it will be better.,2 months ago,1000804789.0

I said if you can guarantee me fresh food I will wait.  He avoided the question and stated he could provide me a credit next time.  I said you did not answer my question and if you cannot provide me fresh product for my wait then I'm not willing to continue this transaction and please close me out.  This experience mirrors one I had in Fort Collins. I feel bad for turning them down for a store management job, I see now they really needed my help in this franchise.

Other than that everything was amazing, along the beach are a lot of walking salesmen. They try to get you to buy anything and everything. But if you go along the beach you can find some shops setup across a bridge and those are really nice with great prices. Drinks are quite delicious and food is mostly great.

Kelly's Joyous Cooking,5.0,"Ok, so it's pizza hut lol. Pretty standard fair, but I happen to LOVE the cheese bread sticks with every fiber of my being lol. My guilty pleasure, so to speak. Fluffy, cheesy, carb-laden goodness 😁 Today I placed an online order and came to the restaurant at the designated time to pick up my order. It was clean and modern and the staff was super friendly. They forgot to make my order, and instead of blaming and denying the manager (Niles) did something you rarely see: apologize and acknowledge. I wish more places realized that's the real first step in making things up to the customer. Sincere and honest. And that's exactly what he did. He also offered me some credit for future use to make up for my time. Not only will I continue to come back to this location (unlike the Windsor Domino's, which is the polar opposite to this in terms of customer service, and a place I will NEVER return to) but I will also recommend. Thank you for rectifying a mistake in the best way possible. You are going a great job!!! And the breadsticks with cheese was yummy as always ❤️",a year ago,1000804789.0

If the bathrooms are any indication of the cleanliness of the kitchen, YUCK!   The booths are always sticky.

Having not ate at a physical PH for 10+ years, we had no idea. They do not make medium pizzas anymore on a deal. You have to order these square pizzas. And they are horrible. Hardly any cheese, no sauce. Since we had to order 3 of them for $20, I assumed they could just box one of them and bring us the other two. This lady brings us a giant box and puts it on the table next to us. I asked if that w as our food and she said yes. Umm then why are you putting on another table? Why aren’t you bringing us plates? We waited a good 5 minutes, our waitress never came over so we ate of napkins, and pizza out of a box. We might as well just ate at home. Service sucked. Pizza sucked. Still paid full price. I will never go back here and hope you think twice before you do also. There’s a reason that parking lot was empty on a Saturday night at 6pm..",2 years ago,1000804789.0
